First Citizen: <|nl|> Before we proceed any further, hear me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Speak, speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> You are all resolved rather to die than to famish? <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Resolved. resolved. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> We know't, we know't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price. <|nl|> Is't a verdict? <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> One word, good citizens. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. <|nl|> What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they <|nl|> would yield us but the superfluity, while it were <|nl|> wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely; <|nl|> but they think we are too dear: the leanness that <|nl|> afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an <|nl|> inventory to particularise their abundance; our <|nl|> sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with <|nl|> our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I <|nl|> speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Consider you what services he has done for his country? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Very well; and could be content to give him good <|nl|> report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Nay, but speak not maliciously. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did <|nl|> it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be <|nl|> content to say it was for his country he did it to <|nl|> please his mother and to be partly proud; which he <|nl|> is, even till the altitude of his virtue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> What he cannot help in his nature, you account a <|nl|> vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; <|nl|> he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition. <|nl|> What shouts are these? The other side o' the city <|nl|> is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol! <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Come, come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Soft! who comes here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved <|nl|> the people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you <|nl|> With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have <|nl|> had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, <|nl|> which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor <|nl|> suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we <|nl|> have strong arms too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours, <|nl|> Will you undo yourselves? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> We cannot, sir, we are undone already. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I tell you, friends, most charitable care <|nl|> Have the patricians of you. For your wants, <|nl|> Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well <|nl|> Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them <|nl|> Against the Roman state, whose course will on <|nl|> The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs <|nl|> Of more strong link asunder than can ever <|nl|> Appear in your impediment. For the dearth, <|nl|> The gods, not the patricians, make it, and <|nl|> Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack, <|nl|> You are transported by calamity <|nl|> Thither where more attends you, and you slander <|nl|> The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers, <|nl|> When you curse them as enemies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us <|nl|> yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses <|nl|> crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to <|nl|> support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act <|nl|> established against the rich, and provide more <|nl|> piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain <|nl|> the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and <|nl|> there's all the love they bear us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Either you must <|nl|> Confess yourselves wondrous malicious, <|nl|> Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you <|nl|> A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it; <|nl|> But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture <|nl|> To stale 't a little more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to <|nl|> fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please <|nl|> you, deliver. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> There was a time when all the body's members <|nl|> Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it: <|nl|> That only like a gulf it did remain <|nl|> I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive, <|nl|> Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing <|nl|> Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments <|nl|> Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel, <|nl|> And, mutually participate, did minister <|nl|> Unto the appetite and affection common <|nl|> Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Well, sir, what answer made the belly? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile, <|nl|> Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-- <|nl|> For, look you, I may make the belly smile <|nl|> As well as speak--it tauntingly replied <|nl|> To the discontented members, the mutinous parts <|nl|> That envied his receipt; even so most fitly <|nl|> As you malign our senators for that <|nl|> They are not such as you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Your belly's answer? What! <|nl|> The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye, <|nl|> The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier, <|nl|> Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter. <|nl|> With other muniments and petty helps <|nl|> In this our fabric, if that they-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> What then? <|nl|> 'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd, <|nl|> Who is the sink o' the body,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Well, what then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> The former agents, if they did complain, <|nl|> What could the belly answer? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I will tell you <|nl|> If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little-- <|nl|> Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Ye're long about it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Note me this, good friend; <|nl|> Your most grave belly was deliberate, <|nl|> Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd: <|nl|> 'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he, <|nl|> 'That I receive the general food at first, <|nl|> Which you do live upon; and fit it is, <|nl|> Because I am the store-house and the shop <|nl|> Of the whole body: but, if you do remember, <|nl|> I send it through the rivers of your blood, <|nl|> Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain; <|nl|> And, through the cranks and offices of man, <|nl|> The strongest nerves and small inferior veins <|nl|> From me receive that natural competency <|nl|> Whereby they live: and though that all at once, <|nl|> You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Ay, sir; well, well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> 'Though all at once cannot <|nl|> See what I do deliver out to each, <|nl|> Yet I can make my audit up, that all <|nl|> From me do back receive the flour of all, <|nl|> And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> It was an answer: how apply you this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> The senators of Rome are this good belly, <|nl|> And you the mutinous members; for examine <|nl|> Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly <|nl|> Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find <|nl|> No public benefit which you receive <|nl|> But it proceeds or comes from them to you <|nl|> And no way from yourselves. What do you think, <|nl|> You, the great toe of this assembly? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> I the great toe! why the great toe? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest, <|nl|> Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost: <|nl|> Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run, <|nl|> Lead'st first to win some vantage. <|nl|> But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs: <|nl|> Rome and her rats are at the point of battle; <|nl|> The one side must have bale. <|nl|> Hail, noble Marcius! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, <|nl|> That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, <|nl|> Make yourselves scabs? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> We have ever your good word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> He that will give good words to thee will flatter <|nl|> Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs, <|nl|> That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you, <|nl|> The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you, <|nl|> Where he should find you lions, finds you hares; <|nl|> Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no, <|nl|> Than is the coal of fire upon the ice, <|nl|> Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is <|nl|> To make him worthy whose offence subdues him <|nl|> And curse that justice did it. <|nl|> Who deserves greatness <|nl|> Deserves your hate; and your affections are <|nl|> A sick man's appetite, who desires most that <|nl|> Which would increase his evil. He that depends <|nl|> Upon your favours swims with fins of lead <|nl|> And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye? <|nl|> With every minute you do change a mind, <|nl|> And call him noble that was now your hate, <|nl|> Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter, <|nl|> That in these several places of the city <|nl|> You cry against the noble senate, who, <|nl|> Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else <|nl|> Would feed on one another? What's their seeking? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say, <|nl|> The city is well stored. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Hang 'em! They say! <|nl|> They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know <|nl|> What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise, <|nl|> Who thrives and who declines; side factions <|nl|> and give out <|nl|> Conjectural marriages; making parties strong <|nl|> And feebling such as stand not in their liking <|nl|> Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's <|nl|> grain enough! <|nl|> Would the nobility lay aside their ruth, <|nl|> And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry <|nl|> With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high <|nl|> As I could pick my lance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded; <|nl|> For though abundantly they lack discretion, <|nl|> Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you, <|nl|> What says the other troop? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> They are dissolved: hang 'em! <|nl|> They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs, <|nl|> That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat, <|nl|> That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not <|nl|> Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds <|nl|> They vented their complainings; which being answer'd, <|nl|> And a petition granted them, a strange one-- <|nl|> To break the heart of generosity, <|nl|> And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps <|nl|> As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon, <|nl|> Shouting their emulation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> What is granted them? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms, <|nl|> Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus, <|nl|> Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath! <|nl|> The rabble should have first unroof'd the city, <|nl|> Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time <|nl|> Win upon power and throw forth greater themes <|nl|> For insurrection's arguing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> This is strange. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Go, get you home, you fragments! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Where's Caius Marcius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Here: what's the matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent <|nl|> Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us; <|nl|> The Volsces are in arms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> They have a leader, <|nl|> Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't. <|nl|> I sin in envying his nobility, <|nl|> And were I any thing but what I am, <|nl|> I would wish me only he. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> You have fought together. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Were half to half the world by the ears and he. <|nl|> Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make <|nl|> Only my wars with him: he is a lion <|nl|> That I am proud to hunt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Then, worthy Marcius, <|nl|> Attend upon Cominius to these wars. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> It is your former promise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Sir, it is; <|nl|> And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou <|nl|> Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face. <|nl|> What, art thou stiff? stand'st out? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TITUS: <|nl|> No, Caius Marcius; <|nl|> I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other, <|nl|> Ere stay behind this business. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> O, true-bred! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Your company to the Capitol; where, I know, <|nl|> Our greatest friends attend us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TITUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Noble Marcius! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Nay, let them follow: <|nl|> The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither <|nl|> To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners, <|nl|> Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> He has no equal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> When we were chosen tribunes for the people,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Mark'd you his lip and eyes? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Nay. but his taunts. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Be-mock the modest moon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> The present wars devour him: he is grown <|nl|> Too proud to be so valiant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Such a nature, <|nl|> Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow <|nl|> Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder <|nl|> His insolence can brook to be commanded <|nl|> Under Cominius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Fame, at the which he aims, <|nl|> In whom already he's well graced, can not <|nl|> Better be held nor more attain'd than by <|nl|> A place below the first: for what miscarries <|nl|> Shall be the general's fault, though he perform <|nl|> To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure <|nl|> Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he <|nl|> Had borne the business!' <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Besides, if things go well, <|nl|> Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall <|nl|> Of his demerits rob Cominius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Come: <|nl|> Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius. <|nl|> Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults <|nl|> To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed <|nl|> In aught he merit not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Let's hence, and hear <|nl|> How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion, <|nl|> More than his singularity, he goes <|nl|> Upon this present action. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Lets along. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> So, your opinion is, Aufidius, <|nl|> That they of Rome are entered in our counsels <|nl|> And know how we proceed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Is it not yours? <|nl|> What ever have been thought on in this state, <|nl|> That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome <|nl|> Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone <|nl|> Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think <|nl|> I have the letter here; yes, here it is. <|nl|> 'They have press'd a power, but it is not known <|nl|> Whether for east or west: the dearth is great; <|nl|> The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd, <|nl|> Cominius, Marcius your old enemy, <|nl|> Who is of Rome worse hated than of you, <|nl|> And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman, <|nl|> These three lead on this preparation <|nl|> Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you: <|nl|> Consider of it.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Our army's in the field <|nl|> We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready <|nl|> To answer us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Nor did you think it folly <|nl|> To keep your great pretences veil'd till when <|nl|> They needs must show themselves; which <|nl|> in the hatching, <|nl|> It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery. <|nl|> We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was <|nl|> To take in many towns ere almost Rome <|nl|> Should know we were afoot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> Noble Aufidius, <|nl|> Take your commission; hie you to your bands: <|nl|> Let us alone to guard Corioli: <|nl|> If they set down before 's, for the remove <|nl|> Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find <|nl|> They've not prepared for us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> O, doubt not that; <|nl|> I speak from certainties. Nay, more, <|nl|> Some parcels of their power are forth already, <|nl|> And only hitherward. I leave your honours. <|nl|> If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet, <|nl|> 'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike <|nl|> Till one can do no more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> The gods assist you! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> And keep your honours safe! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> Farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a <|nl|> more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I <|nl|> should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he <|nl|> won honour than in the embracements of his bed where <|nl|> he would show most love. When yet he was but <|nl|> tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when <|nl|> youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when <|nl|> for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not <|nl|> sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering <|nl|> how honour would become such a person. that it was <|nl|> no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if <|nl|> renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek <|nl|> danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel <|nl|> war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows <|nl|> bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not <|nl|> more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child <|nl|> than now in first seeing he had proved himself a <|nl|> man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> But had he died in the business, madam; how then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Then his good report should have been my son; I <|nl|> therein would have found issue. Hear me profess <|nl|> sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love <|nl|> alike and none less dear than thine and my good <|nl|> Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their <|nl|> country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gentlewoman: <|nl|> Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Indeed, you shall not. <|nl|> Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum, <|nl|> See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair, <|nl|> As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him: <|nl|> Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus: <|nl|> 'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear, <|nl|> Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow <|nl|> With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes, <|nl|> Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow <|nl|> Or all or lose his hire. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Away, you fool! it more becomes a man <|nl|> Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba, <|nl|> When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier <|nl|> Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood <|nl|> At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria, <|nl|> We are fit to bid her welcome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee <|nl|> And tread upon his neck. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> My ladies both, good day to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Sweet madam. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> I am glad to see your ladyship. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers. <|nl|> What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good <|nl|> faith. How does your little son? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> I thank your ladyship; well, good madam. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than <|nl|> look upon his school-master. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a <|nl|> very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o' <|nl|> Wednesday half an hour together: has such a <|nl|> confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded <|nl|> butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go <|nl|> again; and after it again; and over and over he <|nl|> comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his <|nl|> fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his <|nl|> teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked <|nl|> it! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> One on 's father's moods. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> A crack, madam. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play <|nl|> the idle husewife with me this afternoon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> No, good madam; I will not out of doors. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> Not out of doors! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> She shall, she shall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the <|nl|> threshold till my lord return from the wars. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come, <|nl|> you must go visit the good lady that lies in. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with <|nl|> my prayers; but I cannot go thither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Why, I pray you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all <|nl|> the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill <|nl|> Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric <|nl|> were sensible as your finger, that you might leave <|nl|> pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you <|nl|> excellent news of your husband. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> O, good madam, there can be none yet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from <|nl|> him last night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> Indeed, madam? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it. <|nl|> Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against <|nl|> whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of <|nl|> our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set <|nl|> down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt <|nl|> prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true, <|nl|> on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every <|nl|> thing hereafter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but <|nl|> disease our better mirth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then. <|nl|> Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy <|nl|> solemness out o' door. and go along with us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish <|nl|> you much mirth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> Well, then, farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Yonder comes news. A wager they have met. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> My horse to yours, no. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> 'Tis done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> Agreed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Say, has our general met the enemy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> So, the good horse is mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> I'll buy him of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will <|nl|> For half a hundred years. Summon the town. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> How far off lie these armies? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Within this mile and half. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours. <|nl|> Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work, <|nl|> That we with smoking swords may march from hence, <|nl|> To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast. <|nl|> Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> No, nor a man that fears you less than he, <|nl|> That's lesser than a little. <|nl|> Hark! our drums <|nl|> Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls, <|nl|> Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates, <|nl|> Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes; <|nl|> They'll open of themselves. <|nl|> Hark you. far off! <|nl|> There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes <|nl|> Amongst your cloven army. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> O, they are at it! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> They fear us not, but issue forth their city. <|nl|> Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight <|nl|> With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, <|nl|> brave Titus: <|nl|> They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts, <|nl|> Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows: <|nl|> He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce, <|nl|> And he shall feel mine edge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> All the contagion of the south light on you, <|nl|> You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues <|nl|> Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd <|nl|> Further than seen and one infect another <|nl|> Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese, <|nl|> That bear the shapes of men, how have you run <|nl|> From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell! <|nl|> All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale <|nl|> With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home, <|nl|> Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe <|nl|> And make my wars on you: look to't: come on; <|nl|> If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives, <|nl|> As they us to our trenches followed. <|nl|> So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds: <|nl|> 'Tis for the followers fortune widens them, <|nl|> Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Soldier: <|nl|> Fool-hardiness; not I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Soldier: <|nl|> Nor I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Soldier: <|nl|> See, they have shut him in. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> To the pot, I warrant him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> What is become of Marcius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Slain, sir, doubtless. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Soldier: <|nl|> Following the fliers at the very heels, <|nl|> With them he enters; who, upon the sudden, <|nl|> Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone, <|nl|> To answer all the city. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> O noble fellow! <|nl|> Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword, <|nl|> And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius: <|nl|> A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art, <|nl|> Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier <|nl|> Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible <|nl|> Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and <|nl|> The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds, <|nl|> Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world <|nl|> Were feverous and did tremble. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Soldier: <|nl|> Look, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> O,'tis Marcius! <|nl|> Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Roman: <|nl|> This will I carry to Rome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Roman: <|nl|> And I this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Roman: <|nl|> A murrain on't! I took this for silver. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> See here these movers that do prize their hours <|nl|> At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons, <|nl|> Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would <|nl|> Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves, <|nl|> Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them! <|nl|> And hark, what noise the general makes! To him! <|nl|> There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius, <|nl|> Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take <|nl|> Convenient numbers to make good the city; <|nl|> Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste <|nl|> To help Cominius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> Worthy sir, thou bleed'st; <|nl|> Thy exercise hath been too violent for <|nl|> A second course of fight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Sir, praise me not; <|nl|> My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well: <|nl|> The blood I drop is rather physical <|nl|> Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus <|nl|> I will appear, and fight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> Now the fair goddess, Fortune, <|nl|> Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms <|nl|> Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman, <|nl|> Prosperity be thy page! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Thy friend no less <|nl|> Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> Thou worthiest Marcius! <|nl|> Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place; <|nl|> Call thither all the officers o' the town, <|nl|> Where they shall know our mind: away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Breathe you, my friends: well fought; <|nl|> we are come off <|nl|> Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands, <|nl|> Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs, <|nl|> We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck, <|nl|> By interims and conveying gusts we have heard <|nl|> The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods! <|nl|> Lead their successes as we wish our own, <|nl|> That both our powers, with smiling <|nl|> fronts encountering, <|nl|> May give you thankful sacrifice. <|nl|> Thy news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> The citizens of Corioli have issued, <|nl|> And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle: <|nl|> I saw our party to their trenches driven, <|nl|> And then I came away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Though thou speak'st truth, <|nl|> Methinks thou speak'st not well. <|nl|> How long is't since? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Above an hour, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> 'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums: <|nl|> How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour, <|nl|> And bring thy news so late? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Spies of the Volsces <|nl|> Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel <|nl|> Three or four miles about, else had I, sir, <|nl|> Half an hour since brought my report. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Who's yonder, <|nl|> That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods <|nl|> He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have <|nl|> Before-time seen him thus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour <|nl|> More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue <|nl|> From every meaner man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Come I too late? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Ay, if you come not in the blood of others, <|nl|> But mantled in your own. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> O, let me clip ye <|nl|> In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart <|nl|> As merry as when our nuptial day was done, <|nl|> And tapers burn'd to bedward! <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Flower of warriors, <|nl|> How is it with Titus Lartius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> As with a man busied about decrees: <|nl|> Condemning some to death, and some to exile; <|nl|> Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other; <|nl|> Holding Corioli in the name of Rome, <|nl|> Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash, <|nl|> To let him slip at will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Where is that slave <|nl|> Which told me they had beat you to your trenches? <|nl|> Where is he? call him hither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Let him alone; <|nl|> He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen, <|nl|> The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!-- <|nl|> The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge <|nl|> From rascals worse than they. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> But how prevail'd you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Will the time serve to tell? I do not think. <|nl|> Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field? <|nl|> If not, why cease you till you are so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Marcius, <|nl|> We have at disadvantage fought and did <|nl|> Retire to win our purpose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> How lies their battle? know you on which side <|nl|> They have placed their men of trust? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> As I guess, Marcius, <|nl|> Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates, <|nl|> Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius, <|nl|> Their very heart of hope. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> I do beseech you, <|nl|> By all the battles wherein we have fought, <|nl|> By the blood we have shed together, by the vows <|nl|> We have made to endure friends, that you directly <|nl|> Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates; <|nl|> And that you not delay the present, but, <|nl|> Filling the air with swords advanced and darts, <|nl|> We prove this very hour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Though I could wish <|nl|> You were conducted to a gentle bath <|nl|> And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never <|nl|> Deny your asking: take your choice of those <|nl|> That best can aid your action. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Those are they <|nl|> That most are willing. If any such be here-- <|nl|> As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting <|nl|> Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear <|nl|> Lesser his person than an ill report; <|nl|> If any think brave death outweighs bad life <|nl|> And that his country's dearer than himself; <|nl|> Let him alone, or so many so minded, <|nl|> Wave thus, to express his disposition, <|nl|> And follow Marcius. <|nl|> O, me alone! make you a sword of me? <|nl|> If these shows be not outward, which of you <|nl|> But is four Volsces? none of you but is <|nl|> Able to bear against the great Aufidius <|nl|> A shield as hard as his. A certain number, <|nl|> Though thanks to all, must I select <|nl|> from all: the rest <|nl|> Shall bear the business in some other fight, <|nl|> As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march; <|nl|> And four shall quickly draw out my command, <|nl|> Which men are best inclined. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> March on, my fellows: <|nl|> Make good this ostentation, and you shall <|nl|> Divide in all with us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties, <|nl|> As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch <|nl|> Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve <|nl|> For a short holding: if we lose the field, <|nl|> We cannot keep the town. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lieutenant: <|nl|> Fear not our care, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> Hence, and shut your gates upon's. <|nl|> Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee <|nl|> Worse than a promise-breaker. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> We hate alike: <|nl|> Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor <|nl|> More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Let the first budger die the other's slave, <|nl|> And the gods doom him after! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> If I fly, Marcius, <|nl|> Holloa me like a hare. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Within these three hours, Tullus, <|nl|> Alone I fought in your Corioli walls, <|nl|> And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood <|nl|> Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge <|nl|> Wrench up thy power to the highest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Wert thou the Hector <|nl|> That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny, <|nl|> Thou shouldst not scape me here. <|nl|> Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me <|nl|> In your condemned seconds. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work, <|nl|> Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it <|nl|> Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles, <|nl|> Where great patricians shall attend and shrug, <|nl|> I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted, <|nl|> And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the <|nl|> dull tribunes, <|nl|> That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours, <|nl|> Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods <|nl|> Our Rome hath such a soldier.' <|nl|> Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast, <|nl|> Having fully dined before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> O general, <|nl|> Here is the steed, we the caparison: <|nl|> Hadst thou beheld-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> Pray now, no more: my mother, <|nl|> Who has a charter to extol her blood, <|nl|> When she does praise me grieves me. I have done <|nl|> As you have done; that's what I can; induced <|nl|> As you have been; that's for my country: <|nl|> He that has but effected his good will <|nl|> Hath overta'en mine act. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> You shall not be <|nl|> The grave of your deserving; Rome must know <|nl|> The value of her own: 'twere a concealment <|nl|> Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement, <|nl|> To hide your doings; and to silence that, <|nl|> Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd, <|nl|> Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you <|nl|> In sign of what you are, not to reward <|nl|> What you have done--before our army hear me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> I have some wounds upon me, and they smart <|nl|> To hear themselves remember'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Should they not, <|nl|> Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude, <|nl|> And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses, <|nl|> Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all <|nl|> The treasure in this field achieved and city, <|nl|> We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth, <|nl|> Before the common distribution, at <|nl|> Your only choice. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> I thank you, general; <|nl|> But cannot make my heart consent to take <|nl|> A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it; <|nl|> And stand upon my common part with those <|nl|> That have beheld the doing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARCIUS: <|nl|> May these same instruments, which you profane, <|nl|> Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall <|nl|> I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be <|nl|> Made all of false-faced soothing! <|nl|> When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk, <|nl|> Let him be made a coverture for the wars! <|nl|> No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd <|nl|> My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.-- <|nl|> Which, without note, here's many else have done,-- <|nl|> You shout me forth <|nl|> In acclamations hyperbolical; <|nl|> As if I loved my little should be dieted <|nl|> In praises sauced with lies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Too modest are you; <|nl|> More cruel to your good report than grateful <|nl|> To us that give you truly: by your patience, <|nl|> If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you, <|nl|> Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles, <|nl|> Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known, <|nl|> As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius <|nl|> Wears this war's garland: in token of the which, <|nl|> My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him, <|nl|> With all his trim belonging; and from this time, <|nl|> For what he did before Corioli, call him, <|nl|> With all the applause and clamour of the host, <|nl|> CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear <|nl|> The addition nobly ever! <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Caius Marcius Coriolanus! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I will go wash; <|nl|> And when my face is fair, you shall perceive <|nl|> Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you. <|nl|> I mean to stride your steed, and at all times <|nl|> To undercrest your good addition <|nl|> To the fairness of my power. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> So, to our tent; <|nl|> Where, ere we do repose us, we will write <|nl|> To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius, <|nl|> Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome <|nl|> The best, with whom we may articulate, <|nl|> For their own good and ours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> I shall, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> The gods begin to mock me. I, that now <|nl|> Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg <|nl|> Of my lord general. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Take't; 'tis yours. What is't? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I sometime lay here in Corioli <|nl|> At a poor man's house; he used me kindly: <|nl|> He cried to me; I saw him prisoner; <|nl|> But then Aufidius was within my view, <|nl|> And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you <|nl|> To give my poor host freedom. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> O, well begg'd! <|nl|> Were he the butcher of my son, he should <|nl|> Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> Marcius, his name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> By Jupiter! forgot. <|nl|> I am weary; yea, my memory is tired. <|nl|> Have we no wine here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Go we to our tent: <|nl|> The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time <|nl|> It should be look'd to: come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> The town is ta'en! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Soldier: <|nl|> 'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Condition! <|nl|> I would I were a Roman; for I cannot, <|nl|> Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition! <|nl|> What good condition can a treaty find <|nl|> I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius, <|nl|> I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me, <|nl|> And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter <|nl|> As often as we eat. By the elements, <|nl|> If e'er again I meet him beard to beard, <|nl|> He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation <|nl|> Hath not that honour in't it had; for where <|nl|> I thought to crush him in an equal force, <|nl|> True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way <|nl|> Or wrath or craft may get him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Soldier: <|nl|> He's the devil. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd <|nl|> With only suffering stain by him; for him <|nl|> Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary, <|nl|> Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol, <|nl|> The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, <|nl|> Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up <|nl|> Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst <|nl|> My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it <|nl|> At home, upon my brother's guard, even there, <|nl|> Against the hospitable canon, would I <|nl|> Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city; <|nl|> Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must <|nl|> Be hostages for Rome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Soldier: <|nl|> Will not you go? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you-- <|nl|> 'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither <|nl|> How the world goes, that to the pace of it <|nl|> I may spur on my journey. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Soldier: <|nl|> I shall, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Good or bad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Not according to the prayer of the people, for they <|nl|> love not Marcius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Nature teaches beasts to know their friends. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Pray you, who does the wolf love? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> The lamb. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the <|nl|> noble Marcius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two <|nl|> are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both: <|nl|> Well, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two <|nl|> have not in abundance? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Especially in pride. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> And topping all others in boasting. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> This is strange now: do you two know how you are <|nl|> censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the <|nl|> right-hand file? do you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both: <|nl|> Why, how are we censured? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both: <|nl|> Well, well, sir, well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of <|nl|> occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience: <|nl|> give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at <|nl|> your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a <|nl|> pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for <|nl|> being proud? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> We do it not alone, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I know you can do very little alone; for your helps <|nl|> are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous <|nl|> single: your abilities are too infant-like for <|nl|> doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you <|nl|> could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, <|nl|> and make but an interior survey of your good selves! <|nl|> O that you could! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> What then, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, <|nl|> proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as <|nl|> any in Rome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Menenius, you are known well enough too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that <|nl|> loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying <|nl|> Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in <|nl|> favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like <|nl|> upon too trivial motion; one that converses more <|nl|> with the buttock of the night than with the forehead <|nl|> of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my <|nl|> malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as <|nl|> you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink <|nl|> you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a <|nl|> crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have <|nl|> delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in <|nl|> compound with the major part of your syllables: and <|nl|> though I must be content to bear with those that say <|nl|> you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that <|nl|> tell you you have good faces. If you see this in <|nl|> the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known <|nl|> well enough too? what barm can your bisson <|nl|> conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be <|nl|> known well enough too? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Come, sir, come, we know you well enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You <|nl|> are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you <|nl|> wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a <|nl|> cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller; <|nl|> and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a <|nl|> second day of audience. When you are hearing a <|nl|> matter between party and party, if you chance to be <|nl|> pinched with the colic, you make faces like <|nl|> mummers; set up the bloody flag against all <|nl|> patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, <|nl|> dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled <|nl|> by your hearing: all the peace you make in their <|nl|> cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are <|nl|> a pair of strange ones. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Come, come, you are well understood to be a <|nl|> perfecter giber for the table than a necessary <|nl|> bencher in the Capitol. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall <|nl|> encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When <|nl|> you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the <|nl|> wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not <|nl|> so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's <|nl|> cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack- <|nl|> saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud; <|nl|> who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors <|nl|> since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the <|nl|> best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to <|nl|> your worships: more of your conversation would <|nl|> infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly <|nl|> plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you. <|nl|> How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon, <|nl|> were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow <|nl|> your eyes so fast? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for <|nl|> the love of Juno, let's go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Ha! Marcius coming home! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous <|nl|> approbation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo! <|nl|> Marcius coming home! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Nay,'tis true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath <|nl|> another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one <|nl|> at home for you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for <|nl|> me! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven <|nl|> years' health; in which time I will make a lip at <|nl|> the physician: the most sovereign prescription in <|nl|> Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative, <|nl|> of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he <|nl|> not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> O, no, no, no. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a' <|nl|> victory in his pocket? the wounds become him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home <|nl|> with the oaken garland. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but <|nl|> Aufidius got off. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that: <|nl|> an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so <|nl|> fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold <|nl|> that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate <|nl|> has letters from the general, wherein he gives my <|nl|> son the whole name of the war: he hath in this <|nl|> action outdone his former deeds doubly <|nl|>  <|nl|> VALERIA: <|nl|> In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his <|nl|> true purchasing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> The gods grant them true! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> True! pow, wow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> True! I'll be sworn they are true. <|nl|> Where is he wounded? <|nl|> God save your good worships! Marcius is coming <|nl|> home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be <|nl|> large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall <|nl|> stand for his place. He received in the repulse of <|nl|> Tarquin seven hurts i' the body. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's <|nl|> nine that I know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five <|nl|> wounds upon him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave. <|nl|> Hark! the trumpets. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he <|nl|> carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears: <|nl|> Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie; <|nl|> Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Herald: <|nl|> Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight <|nl|> Within Corioli gates: where he hath won, <|nl|> With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these <|nl|> In honour follows Coriolanus. <|nl|> Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus! <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> No more of this; it does offend my heart: <|nl|> Pray now, no more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Look, sir, your mother! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> O, <|nl|> You have, I know, petition'd all the gods <|nl|> For my prosperity! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Nay, my good soldier, up; <|nl|> My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and <|nl|> By deed-achieving honour newly named,-- <|nl|> What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?-- <|nl|> But O, thy wife! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> My gracious silence, hail! <|nl|> Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home, <|nl|> That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear, <|nl|> Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear, <|nl|> And mothers that lack sons. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Now, the gods crown thee! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> And live you yet? <|nl|> O my sweet lady, pardon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> I know not where to turn: O, welcome home: <|nl|> And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep <|nl|> And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome. <|nl|> A curse begin at very root on's heart, <|nl|> That is not glad to see thee! You are three <|nl|> That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men, <|nl|> We have some old crab-trees here <|nl|> at home that will not <|nl|> Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors: <|nl|> We call a nettle but a nettle and <|nl|> The faults of fools but folly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Ever right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Menenius ever, ever. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Herald: <|nl|> Give way there, and go on! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> I have lived <|nl|> To see inherited my very wishes <|nl|> And the buildings of my fancy: only <|nl|> There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but <|nl|> Our Rome will cast upon thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Know, good mother, <|nl|> I had rather be their servant in my way, <|nl|> Than sway with them in theirs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> On, to the Capitol! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights <|nl|> Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse <|nl|> Into a rapture lets her baby cry <|nl|> While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins <|nl|> Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck, <|nl|> Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows, <|nl|> Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed <|nl|> With variable complexions, all agreeing <|nl|> In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens <|nl|> Do press among the popular throngs and puff <|nl|> To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames <|nl|> Commit the war of white and damask in <|nl|> Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil <|nl|> Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother <|nl|> As if that whatsoever god who leads him <|nl|> Were slily crept into his human powers <|nl|> And gave him graceful posture. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> On the sudden, <|nl|> I warrant him consul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Then our office may, <|nl|> During his power, go sleep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> He cannot temperately transport his honours <|nl|> From where he should begin and end, but will <|nl|> Lose those he hath won. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> In that there's comfort. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Doubt not <|nl|> The commoners, for whom we stand, but they <|nl|> Upon their ancient malice will forget <|nl|> With the least cause these his new honours, which <|nl|> That he will give them make I as little question <|nl|> As he is proud to do't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> I heard him swear, <|nl|> Were he to stand for consul, never would he <|nl|> Appear i' the market-place nor on him put <|nl|> The napless vesture of humility; <|nl|> Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds <|nl|> To the people, beg their stinking breaths. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> 'Tis right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> It was his word: O, he would miss it rather <|nl|> Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him, <|nl|> And the desire of the nobles. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> I wish no better <|nl|> Than have him hold that purpose and to put it <|nl|> In execution. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> 'Tis most like he will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> It shall be to him then as our good wills, <|nl|> A sure destruction. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> So it must fall out <|nl|> To him or our authorities. For an end, <|nl|> We must suggest the people in what hatred <|nl|> He still hath held them; that to's power he would <|nl|> Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and <|nl|> Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them, <|nl|> In human action and capacity, <|nl|> Of no more soul nor fitness for the world <|nl|> Than camels in the war, who have their provand <|nl|> Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows <|nl|> For sinking under them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> This, as you say, suggested <|nl|> At some time when his soaring insolence <|nl|> Shall touch the people--which time shall not want, <|nl|> If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy <|nl|> As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire <|nl|> To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze <|nl|> Shall darken him for ever. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> What's the matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought <|nl|> That Marcius shall be consul: <|nl|> I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and <|nl|> The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves, <|nl|> Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers, <|nl|> Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended, <|nl|> As to Jove's statue, and the commons made <|nl|> A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts: <|nl|> I never saw the like. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Let's to the Capitol; <|nl|> And carry with us ears and eyes for the time, <|nl|> But hearts for the event. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Have with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Officer: <|nl|> Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand <|nl|> for consulships? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Officer: <|nl|> Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one <|nl|> Coriolanus will carry it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Officer: <|nl|> That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and <|nl|> loves not the common people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Officer: <|nl|> Faith, there had been many great men that have <|nl|> flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there <|nl|> be many that they have loved, they know not <|nl|> wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why, <|nl|> they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for <|nl|> Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate <|nl|> him manifests the true knowledge he has in their <|nl|> disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets <|nl|> them plainly see't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Officer: <|nl|> If he did not care whether he had their love or no, <|nl|> he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither <|nl|> good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater <|nl|> devotion than can render it him; and leaves <|nl|> nothing undone that may fully discover him their <|nl|> opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and <|nl|> displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he <|nl|> dislikes, to flatter them for their love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Officer: <|nl|> He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his <|nl|> ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, <|nl|> having been supple and courteous to the people, <|nl|> bonneted, without any further deed to have them at <|nl|> an into their estimation and report: but he hath so <|nl|> planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions <|nl|> in their hearts, that for their tongues to be <|nl|> silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of <|nl|> ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a <|nl|> malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck <|nl|> reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Officer: <|nl|> No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they <|nl|> are coming. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Having determined of the Volsces and <|nl|> To send for Titus Lartius, it remains, <|nl|> As the main point of this our after-meeting, <|nl|> To gratify his noble service that <|nl|> Hath thus stood for his country: therefore, <|nl|> please you, <|nl|> Most reverend and grave elders, to desire <|nl|> The present consul, and last general <|nl|> In our well-found successes, to report <|nl|> A little of that worthy work perform'd <|nl|> By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom <|nl|> We met here both to thank and to remember <|nl|> With honours like himself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Speak, good Cominius: <|nl|> Leave nothing out for length, and make us think <|nl|> Rather our state's defective for requital <|nl|> Than we to stretch it out. <|nl|> Masters o' the people, <|nl|> We do request your kindest ears, and after, <|nl|> Your loving motion toward the common body, <|nl|> To yield what passes here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> We are convented <|nl|> Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts <|nl|> Inclinable to honour and advance <|nl|> The theme of our assembly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Which the rather <|nl|> We shall be blest to do, if he remember <|nl|> A kinder value of the people than <|nl|> He hath hereto prized them at. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> That's off, that's off; <|nl|> I would you rather had been silent. Please you <|nl|> To hear Cominius speak? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Most willingly; <|nl|> But yet my caution was more pertinent <|nl|> Than the rebuke you give it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> He loves your people <|nl|> But tie him not to be their bedfellow. <|nl|> Worthy Cominius, speak. <|nl|> Nay, keep your place. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear <|nl|> What you have nobly done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Your horror's pardon: <|nl|> I had rather have my wounds to heal again <|nl|> Than hear say how I got them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Sir, I hope <|nl|> My words disbench'd you not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> No, sir: yet oft, <|nl|> When blows have made me stay, I fled from words. <|nl|> You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but <|nl|> your people, <|nl|> I love them as they weigh. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Pray now, sit down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun <|nl|> When the alarum were struck than idly sit <|nl|> To hear my nothings monster'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Masters of the people, <|nl|> Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-- <|nl|> That's thousand to one good one--when you now see <|nl|> He had rather venture all his limbs for honour <|nl|> Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus <|nl|> Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held <|nl|> That valour is the chiefest virtue, and <|nl|> Most dignifies the haver: if it be, <|nl|> The man I speak of cannot in the world <|nl|> Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years, <|nl|> When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought <|nl|> Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator, <|nl|> Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight, <|nl|> When with his Amazonian chin he drove <|nl|> The bristled lips before him: be bestrid <|nl|> An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view <|nl|> Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met, <|nl|> And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats, <|nl|> When he might act the woman in the scene, <|nl|> He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed <|nl|> Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age <|nl|> Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea, <|nl|> And in the brunt of seventeen battles since <|nl|> He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last, <|nl|> Before and in Corioli, let me say, <|nl|> I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers; <|nl|> And by his rare example made the coward <|nl|> Turn terror into sport: as weeds before <|nl|> A vessel under sail, so men obey'd <|nl|> And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp, <|nl|> Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot <|nl|> He was a thing of blood, whose every motion <|nl|> Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd <|nl|> The mortal gate of the city, which he painted <|nl|> With shunless destiny; aidless came off, <|nl|> And with a sudden reinforcement struck <|nl|> Corioli like a planet: now all's his: <|nl|> When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce <|nl|> His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit <|nl|> Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate, <|nl|> And to the battle came he; where he did <|nl|> Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if <|nl|> 'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd <|nl|> Both field and city ours, he never stood <|nl|> To ease his breast with panting. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Worthy man! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> He cannot but with measure fit the honours <|nl|> Which we devise him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Our spoils he kick'd at, <|nl|> And look'd upon things precious as they were <|nl|> The common muck of the world: he covets less <|nl|> Than misery itself would give; rewards <|nl|> His deeds with doing them, and is content <|nl|> To spend the time to end it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> He's right noble: <|nl|> Let him be call'd for. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Call Coriolanus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Officer: <|nl|> He doth appear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased <|nl|> To make thee consul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I do owe them still <|nl|> My life and services. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> It then remains <|nl|> That you do speak to the people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I do beseech you, <|nl|> Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot <|nl|> Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them, <|nl|> For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you <|nl|> That I may pass this doing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Sir, the people <|nl|> Must have their voices; neither will they bate <|nl|> One jot of ceremony. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Put them not to't: <|nl|> Pray you, go fit you to the custom and <|nl|> Take to you, as your predecessors have, <|nl|> Your honour with your form. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> It is apart <|nl|> That I shall blush in acting, and might well <|nl|> Be taken from the people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Mark you that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus; <|nl|> Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, <|nl|> As if I had received them for the hire <|nl|> Of their breath only! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Do not stand upon't. <|nl|> We recommend to you, tribunes of the people, <|nl|> Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul <|nl|> Wish we all joy and honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Senators: <|nl|> To Coriolanus come all joy and honour! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> You see how he intends to use the people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> May they perceive's intent! He will require them, <|nl|> As if he did contemn what he requested <|nl|> Should be in them to give. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Come, we'll inform them <|nl|> Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace, <|nl|> I know, they do attend us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> We may, sir, if we will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a <|nl|> power that we have no power to do; for if he show us <|nl|> his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our <|nl|> tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if <|nl|> he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him <|nl|> our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is <|nl|> monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful, <|nl|> were to make a monster of the multitude: of the <|nl|> which we being members, should bring ourselves to be <|nl|> monstrous members. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> And to make us no better thought of, a little help <|nl|> will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he <|nl|> himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> We have been called so of many; not that our heads <|nl|> are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald, <|nl|> but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and <|nl|> truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of <|nl|> one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south, <|nl|> and their consent of one direct way should be at <|nl|> once to all the points o' the compass. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would <|nl|> fly? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's <|nl|> will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but <|nl|> if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Why that way? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts <|nl|> melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return <|nl|> for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> You are never without your tricks: you may, you may. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Are you all resolved to give your voices? But <|nl|> that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I <|nl|> say, if he would incline to the people, there was <|nl|> never a worthier man. <|nl|> Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his <|nl|> behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to <|nl|> come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and <|nl|> by threes. He's to make his requests by <|nl|> particulars; wherein every one of us has a single <|nl|> honour, in giving him our own voices with our own <|nl|> tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how <|nl|> you shall go by him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Content, content. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> O sir, you are not right: have you not known <|nl|> The worthiest men have done't? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> What must I say? <|nl|> 'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring <|nl|> My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds! <|nl|> I got them in my country's service, when <|nl|> Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran <|nl|> From the noise of our own drums.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> O me, the gods! <|nl|> You must not speak of that: you must desire them <|nl|> To think upon you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Think upon me! hang 'em! <|nl|> I would they would forget me, like the virtues <|nl|> Which our divines lose by 'em. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> You'll mar all: <|nl|> I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you, <|nl|> In wholesome manner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Bid them wash their faces <|nl|> And keep their teeth clean. <|nl|> So, here comes a brace. <|nl|> You know the cause, air, of my standing here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Mine own desert. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Your own desert! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Ay, but not mine own desire. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> How not your own desire? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the <|nl|> poor with begging. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to <|nl|> gain by you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> The price is to ask it kindly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to <|nl|> show you, which shall be yours in private. Your <|nl|> good voice, sir; what say you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> You shall ha' it, worthy sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices <|nl|> begged. I have your alms: adieu. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> But this is something odd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your <|nl|> voices that I may be consul, I have here the <|nl|> customary gown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Fourth Citizen: <|nl|> You have deserved nobly of your country, and you <|nl|> have not deserved nobly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Your enigma? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Fourth Citizen: <|nl|> You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have <|nl|> been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved <|nl|> the common people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> You should account me the more virtuous that I have <|nl|> not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my <|nl|> sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer <|nl|> estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account <|nl|> gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is <|nl|> rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise <|nl|> the insinuating nod and be off to them most <|nl|> counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the <|nl|> bewitchment of some popular man and give it <|nl|> bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you, <|nl|> I may be consul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Fifth Citizen: <|nl|> We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give <|nl|> you our voices heartily. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Fourth Citizen: <|nl|> You have received many wounds for your country. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I <|nl|> will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both Citizens: <|nl|> The gods give you joy, sir, heartily! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Most sweet voices! <|nl|> Better it is to die, better to starve, <|nl|> Than crave the hire which first we do deserve. <|nl|> Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here, <|nl|> To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear, <|nl|> Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't: <|nl|> What custom wills, in all things should we do't, <|nl|> The dust on antique time would lie unswept, <|nl|> And mountainous error be too highly heapt <|nl|> For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so, <|nl|> Let the high office and the honour go <|nl|> To one that would do thus. I am half through; <|nl|> The one part suffer'd, the other will I do. <|nl|> Here come more voices. <|nl|> Your voices: for your voices I have fought; <|nl|> Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear <|nl|> Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six <|nl|> I have seen and heard of; for your voices have <|nl|> Done many things, some less, some more your voices: <|nl|> Indeed I would be consul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Sixth Citizen: <|nl|> He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest <|nl|> man's voice. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Seventh Citizen: <|nl|> Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy, <|nl|> and make him good friend to the people! <|nl|>  <|nl|> All Citizens: <|nl|> Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Worthy voices! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes <|nl|> Endue you with the people's voice: remains <|nl|> That, in the official marks invested, you <|nl|> Anon do meet the senate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Is this done? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> The custom of request you have discharged: <|nl|> The people do admit you, and are summon'd <|nl|> To meet anon, upon your approbation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Where? at the senate-house? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> There, Coriolanus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> May I change these garments? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> You may, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again, <|nl|> Repair to the senate-house. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I'll keep you company. Will you along? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> We stay here for the people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Fare you well. <|nl|> He has it now, and by his looks methink <|nl|> 'Tis warm at 's heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds. <|nl|> will you dismiss the people? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> How now, my masters! have you chose this man? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> He has our voices, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> We pray the gods he may deserve your loves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice, <|nl|> He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Certainly <|nl|> He flouted us downright. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says <|nl|> He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us <|nl|> His marks of merit, wounds received for's country. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Why, so he did, I am sure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> No, no; no man saw 'em. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> He said he had wounds, which he could show <|nl|> in private; <|nl|> And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn, <|nl|> 'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom, <|nl|> But by your voices, will not so permit me; <|nl|> Your voices therefore.' When we granted that, <|nl|> Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you: <|nl|> Your most sweet voices: now you have left <|nl|> your voices, <|nl|> I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Why either were you ignorant to see't, <|nl|> Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness <|nl|> To yield your voices? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Could you not have told him <|nl|> As you were lesson'd, when he had no power, <|nl|> But was a petty servant to the state, <|nl|> He was your enemy, ever spake against <|nl|> Your liberties and the charters that you bear <|nl|> I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving <|nl|> A place of potency and sway o' the state, <|nl|> If he should still malignantly remain <|nl|> Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might <|nl|> Be curses to yourselves? You should have said <|nl|> That as his worthy deeds did claim no less <|nl|> Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature <|nl|> Would think upon you for your voices and <|nl|> Translate his malice towards you into love, <|nl|> Standing your friendly lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Thus to have said, <|nl|> As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit <|nl|> And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd <|nl|> Either his gracious promise, which you might, <|nl|> As cause had call'd you up, have held him to <|nl|> Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature, <|nl|> Which easily endures not article <|nl|> Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage, <|nl|> You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler <|nl|> And pass'd him unelected. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Did you perceive <|nl|> He did solicit you in free contempt <|nl|> When he did need your loves, and do you think <|nl|> That his contempt shall not be bruising to you, <|nl|> When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies <|nl|> No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry <|nl|> Against the rectorship of judgment? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Have you <|nl|> Ere now denied the asker? and now again <|nl|> Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow <|nl|> Your sued-for tongues? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> And will deny him: <|nl|> I'll have five hundred voices of that sound. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends, <|nl|> They have chose a consul that will from them take <|nl|> Their liberties; make them of no more voice <|nl|> Than dogs that are as often beat for barking <|nl|> As therefore kept to do so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Let them assemble, <|nl|> And on a safer judgment all revoke <|nl|> Your ignorant election; enforce his pride, <|nl|> And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not <|nl|> With what contempt he wore the humble weed, <|nl|> How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves, <|nl|> Thinking upon his services, took from you <|nl|> The apprehension of his present portance, <|nl|> Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion <|nl|> After the inveterate hate he bears you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Lay <|nl|> A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured, <|nl|> No impediment between, but that you must <|nl|> Cast your election on him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Say, you chose him <|nl|> More after our commandment than as guided <|nl|> By your own true affections, and that your minds, <|nl|> Preoccupied with what you rather must do <|nl|> Than what you should, made you against the grain <|nl|> To voice him consul: lay the fault on us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you. <|nl|> How youngly he began to serve his country, <|nl|> How long continued, and what stock he springs of, <|nl|> The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came <|nl|> That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son, <|nl|> Who, after great Hostilius, here was king; <|nl|> Of the same house Publius and Quintus were, <|nl|> That our beat water brought by conduits hither; <|nl|> And   <|nl|> Twice being   <|nl|> Was his great ancestor. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> One thus descended, <|nl|> That hath beside well in his person wrought <|nl|> To be set high in place, we did commend <|nl|> To your remembrances: but you have found, <|nl|> Scaling his present bearing with his past, <|nl|> That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke <|nl|> Your sudden approbation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Say, you ne'er had done't-- <|nl|> Harp on that still--but by our putting on; <|nl|> And presently, when you have drawn your number, <|nl|> Repair to the Capitol. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> We will so: almost all <|nl|> Repent in their election. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Let them go on; <|nl|> This mutiny were better put in hazard, <|nl|> Than stay, past doubt, for greater: <|nl|> If, as his nature is, he fall in rage <|nl|> With their refusal, both observe and answer <|nl|> The vantage of his anger. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> To the Capitol, come: <|nl|> We will be there before the stream o' the people; <|nl|> And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own, <|nl|> Which we have goaded onward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Tullus Aufidius then had made new head? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> He had, my lord; and that it was which caused <|nl|> Our swifter composition. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> So then the Volsces stand but as at first, <|nl|> Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road. <|nl|> Upon's again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> They are worn, lord consul, so, <|nl|> That we shall hardly in our ages see <|nl|> Their banners wave again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Saw you Aufidius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse <|nl|> Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely <|nl|> Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Spoke he of me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> He did, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> How? what? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> How often he had met you, sword to sword; <|nl|> That of all things upon the earth he hated <|nl|> Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes <|nl|> To hopeless restitution, so he might <|nl|> Be call'd your vanquisher. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> At Antium lives he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LARTIUS: <|nl|> At Antium. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I wish I had a cause to seek him there, <|nl|> To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home. <|nl|> Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, <|nl|> The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them; <|nl|> For they do prank them in authority, <|nl|> Against all noble sufferance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Pass no further. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Ha! what is that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> It will be dangerous to go on: no further. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> What makes this change? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> The matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Cominius, no. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Have I had children's voices? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> The people are incensed against him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Stop, <|nl|> Or all will fall in broil. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Are these your herd? <|nl|> Must these have voices, that can yield them now <|nl|> And straight disclaim their tongues? What are <|nl|> your offices? <|nl|> You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth? <|nl|> Have you not set them on? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Be calm, be calm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot, <|nl|> To curb the will of the nobility: <|nl|> Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule <|nl|> Nor ever will be ruled. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Call't not a plot: <|nl|> The people cry you mock'd them, and of late, <|nl|> When corn was given them gratis, you repined; <|nl|> Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them <|nl|> Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Why, this was known before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Not to them all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Have you inform'd them sithence? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> How! I inform them! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> You are like to do such business. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Not unlike, <|nl|> Each way, to better yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds, <|nl|> Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me <|nl|> Your fellow tribune. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> You show too much of that <|nl|> For which the people stir: if you will pass <|nl|> To where you are bound, you must inquire your way, <|nl|> Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit, <|nl|> Or never be so noble as a consul, <|nl|> Nor yoke with him for tribune. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Let's be calm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> The people are abused; set on. This paltering <|nl|> Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus <|nl|> Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely <|nl|> I' the plain way of his merit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Tell me of corn! <|nl|> This was my speech, and I will speak't again-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Not now, not now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Not in this heat, sir, now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends, <|nl|> I crave their pardons: <|nl|> For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them <|nl|> Regard me as I do not flatter, and <|nl|> Therein behold themselves: I say again, <|nl|> In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate <|nl|> The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, <|nl|> Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, <|nl|> and scatter'd, <|nl|> By mingling them with us, the honour'd number, <|nl|> Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that <|nl|> Which they have given to beggars. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Well, no more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> No more words, we beseech you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> How! no more! <|nl|> As for my country I have shed my blood, <|nl|> Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs <|nl|> Coin words till their decay against those measles, <|nl|> Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought <|nl|> The very way to catch them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> You speak o' the people, <|nl|> As if you were a god to punish, not <|nl|> A man of their infirmity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> 'Twere well <|nl|> We let the people know't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> What, what? his choler? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Choler! <|nl|> Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, <|nl|> By Jove, 'twould be my mind! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> It is a mind <|nl|> That shall remain a poison where it is, <|nl|> Not poison any further. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Shall remain! <|nl|> Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you <|nl|> His absolute 'shall'? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> 'Twas from the canon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> 'Shall'! <|nl|> O good but most unwise patricians! why, <|nl|> You grave but reckless senators, have you thus <|nl|> Given Hydra here to choose an officer, <|nl|> That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but <|nl|> The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit <|nl|> To say he'll turn your current in a ditch, <|nl|> And make your channel his? If he have power <|nl|> Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake <|nl|> Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd, <|nl|> Be not as common fools; if you are not, <|nl|> Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians, <|nl|> If they be senators: and they are no less, <|nl|> When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste <|nl|> Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate, <|nl|> And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,' <|nl|> His popular 'shall' against a graver bench <|nl|> Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself! <|nl|> It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches <|nl|> To know, when two authorities are up, <|nl|> Neither supreme, how soon confusion <|nl|> May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take <|nl|> The one by the other. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Well, on to the market-place. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth <|nl|> The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used <|nl|> Sometime in Greece,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Well, well, no more of that. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Though there the people had more absolute power, <|nl|> I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed <|nl|> The ruin of the state. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Why, shall the people give <|nl|> One that speaks thus their voice? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I'll give my reasons, <|nl|> More worthier than their voices. They know the corn <|nl|> Was not our recompense, resting well assured <|nl|> That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war, <|nl|> Even when the navel of the state was touch'd, <|nl|> They would not thread the gates. This kind of service <|nl|> Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war <|nl|> Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd <|nl|> Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation <|nl|> Which they have often made against the senate, <|nl|> All cause unborn, could never be the motive <|nl|> Of our so frank donation. Well, what then? <|nl|> How shall this bisson multitude digest <|nl|> The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express <|nl|> What's like to be their words: 'we did request it; <|nl|> We are the greater poll, and in true fear <|nl|> They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase <|nl|> The nature of our seats and make the rabble <|nl|> Call our cares fears; which will in time <|nl|> Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in <|nl|> The crows to peck the eagles. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Come, enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Enough, with over-measure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> No, take more: <|nl|> What may be sworn by, both divine and human, <|nl|> Seal what I end withal! This double worship, <|nl|> Where one part does disdain with cause, the other <|nl|> Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom, <|nl|> Cannot conclude but by the yea and no <|nl|> Of general ignorance,--it must omit <|nl|> Real necessities, and give way the while <|nl|> To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, <|nl|> it follows, <|nl|> Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,-- <|nl|> You that will be less fearful than discreet, <|nl|> That love the fundamental part of state <|nl|> More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer <|nl|> A noble life before a long, and wish <|nl|> To jump a body with a dangerous physic <|nl|> That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out <|nl|> The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick <|nl|> The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour <|nl|> Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state <|nl|> Of that integrity which should become't, <|nl|> Not having the power to do the good it would, <|nl|> For the in which doth control't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Has said enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer <|nl|> As traitors do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee! <|nl|> What should the people do with these bald tribunes? <|nl|> On whom depending, their obedience fails <|nl|> To the greater bench: in a rebellion, <|nl|> When what's not meet, but what must be, was law, <|nl|> Then were they chosen: in a better hour, <|nl|> Let what is meet be said it must be meet, <|nl|> And throw their power i' the dust. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Manifest treason! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> This a consul? no. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> The aediles, ho! <|nl|> Let him be apprehended. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Go, call the people: <|nl|> in whose name myself <|nl|> Attach thee as a traitorous innovator, <|nl|> A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee, <|nl|> And follow to thine answer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Hence, old goat! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Senators, &C: <|nl|> We'll surety him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Aged sir, hands off. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones <|nl|> Out of thy garments. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Help, ye citizens! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> On both sides more respect. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Here's he that would take from you all your power. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Seize him, AEdiles! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> Down with him! down with him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Senators, &C: <|nl|> Weapons, weapons, weapons! <|nl|> 'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!' <|nl|> 'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!' <|nl|> 'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!' <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> What is about to be? I am out of breath; <|nl|> Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes <|nl|> To the people! Coriolanus, patience! <|nl|> Speak, good Sicinius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Hear me, people; peace! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> You are at point to lose your liberties: <|nl|> Marcius would have all from you; Marcius, <|nl|> Whom late you have named for consul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Fie, fie, fie! <|nl|> This is the way to kindle, not to quench. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> To unbuild the city and to lay all flat. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> What is the city but the people? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> True, <|nl|> The people are the city. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> By the consent of all, we were establish'd <|nl|> The people's magistrates. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> You so remain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> And so are like to do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> That is the way to lay the city flat; <|nl|> To bring the roof to the foundation, <|nl|> And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges, <|nl|> In heaps and piles of ruin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> This deserves death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Or let us stand to our authority, <|nl|> Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce, <|nl|> Upon the part o' the people, in whose power <|nl|> We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy <|nl|> Of present death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Therefore lay hold of him; <|nl|> Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence <|nl|> Into destruction cast him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> AEdiles, seize him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> Yield, Marcius, yield! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Hear me one word; <|nl|> Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> Peace, peace! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Sir, those cold ways, <|nl|> That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous <|nl|> Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him, <|nl|> And bear him to the rock. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> No, I'll die here. <|nl|> There's some among you have beheld me fighting: <|nl|> Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Lay hands upon him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Help Marcius, help, <|nl|> You that be noble; help him, young and old! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> Down with him, down with him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Go, get you to your house; be gone, away! <|nl|> All will be naught else. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> Get you gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Stand fast; <|nl|> We have as many friends as enemies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Sham it be put to that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> The gods forbid! <|nl|> I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house; <|nl|> Leave us to cure this cause. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> For 'tis a sore upon us, <|nl|> You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Come, sir, along with us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I would they were barbarians--as they are, <|nl|> Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not, <|nl|> Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Be gone; <|nl|> Put not your worthy rage into your tongue; <|nl|> One time will owe another. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> On fair ground <|nl|> I could beat forty of them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> I could myself <|nl|> Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the <|nl|> two tribunes: <|nl|> But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic; <|nl|> And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands <|nl|> Against a falling fabric. Will you hence, <|nl|> Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend <|nl|> Like interrupted waters and o'erbear <|nl|> What they are used to bear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Pray you, be gone: <|nl|> I'll try whether my old wit be in request <|nl|> With those that have but little: this must be patch'd <|nl|> With cloth of any colour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Nay, come away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> A Patrician: <|nl|> This man has marr'd his fortune. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> His nature is too noble for the world: <|nl|> He would not flatter Neptune for his trident, <|nl|> Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth: <|nl|> What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent; <|nl|> And, being angry, does forget that ever <|nl|> He heard the name of death. <|nl|> Here's goodly work! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Patrician: <|nl|> I would they were abed! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance! <|nl|> Could he not speak 'em fair? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Where is this viper <|nl|> That would depopulate the city and <|nl|> Be every man himself? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> You worthy tribunes,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock <|nl|> With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law, <|nl|> And therefore law shall scorn him further trial <|nl|> Than the severity of the public power <|nl|> Which he so sets at nought. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> He shall well know <|nl|> The noble tribunes are the people's mouths, <|nl|> And we their hands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> He shall, sure on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Sir, sir,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Peace! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt <|nl|> With modest warrant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Sir, how comes't that you <|nl|> Have holp to make this rescue? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Hear me speak: <|nl|> As I do know the consul's worthiness, <|nl|> So can I name his faults,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Consul! what consul? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> The consul Coriolanus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> He consul! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> No, no, no, no, no. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people, <|nl|> I may be heard, I would crave a word or two; <|nl|> The which shall turn you to no further harm <|nl|> Than so much loss of time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Speak briefly then; <|nl|> For we are peremptory to dispatch <|nl|> This viperous traitor: to eject him hence <|nl|> Were but one danger, and to keep him here <|nl|> Our certain death: therefore it is decreed <|nl|> He dies to-night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Now the good gods forbid <|nl|> That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude <|nl|> Towards her deserved children is enroll'd <|nl|> In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam <|nl|> Should now eat up her own! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> He's a disease that must be cut away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> O, he's a limb that has but a disease; <|nl|> Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy. <|nl|> What has he done to Rome that's worthy death? <|nl|> Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost-- <|nl|> Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath, <|nl|> By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country; <|nl|> And what is left, to lose it by his country, <|nl|> Were to us all, that do't and suffer it, <|nl|> A brand to the end o' the world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> This is clean kam. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Merely awry: when he did love his country, <|nl|> It honour'd him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> The service of the foot <|nl|> Being once gangrened, is not then respected <|nl|> For what before it was. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> We'll hear no more. <|nl|> Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence: <|nl|> Lest his infection, being of catching nature, <|nl|> Spread further. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> One word more, one word. <|nl|> This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find <|nl|> The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late <|nl|> Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process; <|nl|> Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out, <|nl|> And sack great Rome with Romans. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> If it were so,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> What do ye talk? <|nl|> Have we not had a taste of his obedience? <|nl|> Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars <|nl|> Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd <|nl|> In bolted language; meal and bran together <|nl|> He throws without distinction. Give me leave, <|nl|> I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him <|nl|> Where he shall answer, by a lawful form, <|nl|> In peace, to his utmost peril. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Noble tribunes, <|nl|> It is the humane way: the other course <|nl|> Will prove too bloody, and the end of it <|nl|> Unknown to the beginning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Noble Menenius, <|nl|> Be you then as the people's officer. <|nl|> Masters, lay down your weapons. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Go not home. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there: <|nl|> Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed <|nl|> In our first way. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I'll bring him to you. <|nl|> Let me desire your company: he must come, <|nl|> Or what is worst will follow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Pray you, let's to him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Let them puff all about mine ears, present me <|nl|> Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels, <|nl|> Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock, <|nl|> That the precipitation might down stretch <|nl|> Below the beam of sight, yet will I still <|nl|> Be thus to them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> A Patrician: <|nl|> You do the nobler. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I muse my mother <|nl|> Does not approve me further, who was wont <|nl|> To call them woollen vassals, things created <|nl|> To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads <|nl|> In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder, <|nl|> When one but of my ordinance stood up <|nl|> To speak of peace or war. <|nl|> I talk of you: <|nl|> Why did you wish me milder? would you have me <|nl|> False to my nature? Rather say I play <|nl|> The man I am. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> O, sir, sir, sir, <|nl|> I would have had you put your power well on, <|nl|> Before you had worn it out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Let go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> You might have been enough the man you are, <|nl|> With striving less to be so; lesser had been <|nl|> The thwartings of your dispositions, if <|nl|> You had not show'd them how ye were disposed <|nl|> Ere they lack'd power to cross you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Let them hang. <|nl|>  <|nl|> A Patrician: <|nl|> Ay, and burn too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Come, come, you have been too rough, something <|nl|> too rough; <|nl|> You must return and mend it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> There's no remedy; <|nl|> Unless, by not so doing, our good city <|nl|> Cleave in the midst, and perish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Pray, be counsell'd: <|nl|> I have a heart as little apt as yours, <|nl|> But yet a brain that leads my use of anger <|nl|> To better vantage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Well said, noble woman? <|nl|> Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that <|nl|> The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic <|nl|> For the whole state, I would put mine armour on, <|nl|> Which I can scarcely bear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> What must I do? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Return to the tribunes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Well, what then? what then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Repent what you have spoke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> For them! I cannot do it to the gods; <|nl|> Must I then do't to them? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> You are too absolute; <|nl|> Though therein you can never be too noble, <|nl|> But when extremities speak. I have heard you say, <|nl|> Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, <|nl|> I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me, <|nl|> In peace what each of them by the other lose, <|nl|> That they combine not there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Tush, tush! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> A good demand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> If it be honour in your wars to seem <|nl|> The same you are not, which, for your best ends, <|nl|> You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse, <|nl|> That it shall hold companionship in peace <|nl|> With honour, as in war, since that to both <|nl|> It stands in like request? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Why force you this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Because that now it lies you on to speak <|nl|> To the people; not by your own instruction, <|nl|> Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you, <|nl|> But with such words that are but rooted in <|nl|> Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables <|nl|> Of no allowance to your bosom's truth. <|nl|> Now, this no more dishonours you at all <|nl|> Than to take in a town with gentle words, <|nl|> Which else would put you to your fortune and <|nl|> The hazard of much blood. <|nl|> I would dissemble with my nature where <|nl|> My fortunes and my friends at stake required <|nl|> I should do so in honour: I am in this, <|nl|> Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles; <|nl|> And you will rather show our general louts <|nl|> How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em, <|nl|> For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard <|nl|> Of what that want might ruin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Noble lady! <|nl|> Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so, <|nl|> Not what is dangerous present, but the loss <|nl|> Of what is past. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> I prithee now, my son, <|nl|> Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand; <|nl|> And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them-- <|nl|> Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business <|nl|> Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant <|nl|> More learned than the ears--waving thy head, <|nl|> Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart, <|nl|> Now humble as the ripest mulberry <|nl|> That will not hold the handling: or say to them, <|nl|> Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils <|nl|> Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess, <|nl|> Were fit for thee to use as they to claim, <|nl|> In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame <|nl|> Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far <|nl|> As thou hast power and person. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> This but done, <|nl|> Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours; <|nl|> For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free <|nl|> As words to little purpose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Prithee now, <|nl|> Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather <|nl|> Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf <|nl|> Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit <|nl|> You make strong party, or defend yourself <|nl|> By calmness or by absence: all's in anger. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Only fair speech. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> I think 'twill serve, if he <|nl|> Can thereto frame his spirit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> He must, and will <|nl|> Prithee now, say you will, and go about it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce? <|nl|> Must I with base tongue give my noble heart <|nl|> A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't: <|nl|> Yet, were there but this single plot to lose, <|nl|> This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it <|nl|> And throw't against the wind. To the market-place! <|nl|> You have put me now to such a part which never <|nl|> I shall discharge to the life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Come, come, we'll prompt you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said <|nl|> My praises made thee first a soldier, so, <|nl|> To have my praise for this, perform a part <|nl|> Thou hast not done before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Well, I must do't: <|nl|> Away, my disposition, and possess me <|nl|> Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd, <|nl|> Which quired with my drum, into a pipe <|nl|> Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice <|nl|> That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves <|nl|> Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up <|nl|> The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue <|nl|> Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees, <|nl|> Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his <|nl|> That hath received an alms! I will not do't, <|nl|> Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth <|nl|> And by my body's action teach my mind <|nl|> A most inherent baseness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> At thy choice, then: <|nl|> To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour <|nl|> Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let <|nl|> Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear <|nl|> Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death <|nl|> With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list <|nl|> Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me, <|nl|> But owe thy pride thyself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Pray, be content: <|nl|> Mother, I am going to the market-place; <|nl|> Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves, <|nl|> Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved <|nl|> Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going: <|nl|> Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul; <|nl|> Or never trust to what my tongue can do <|nl|> I' the way of flattery further. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Do your will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself <|nl|> To answer mildly; for they are prepared <|nl|> With accusations, as I hear, more strong <|nl|> Than are upon you yet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go: <|nl|> Let them accuse me by invention, I <|nl|> Will answer in mine honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Ay, but mildly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Well, mildly be it then. Mildly! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> In this point charge him home, that he affects <|nl|> Tyrannical power: if he evade us there, <|nl|> Enforce him with his envy to the people, <|nl|> And that the spoil got on the Antiates <|nl|> Was ne'er distributed. <|nl|> What, will he come? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> He's coming. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> How accompanied? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> With old Menenius, and those senators <|nl|> That always favour'd him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Have you a catalogue <|nl|> Of all the voices that we have procured <|nl|> Set down by the poll? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> I have; 'tis ready. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Have you collected them by tribes? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> I have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Assemble presently the people hither; <|nl|> And when they bear me say 'It shall be so <|nl|> I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either <|nl|> For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them <|nl|> If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.' <|nl|> Insisting on the old prerogative <|nl|> And power i' the truth o' the cause. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> I shall inform them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> And when such time they have begun to cry, <|nl|> Let them not cease, but with a din confused <|nl|> Enforce the present execution <|nl|> Of what we chance to sentence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> Very well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Make them be strong and ready for this hint, <|nl|> When we shall hap to give 't them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Go about it. <|nl|> Put him to choler straight: he hath been used <|nl|> Ever to conquer, and to have his worth <|nl|> Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot <|nl|> Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks <|nl|> What's in his heart; and that is there which looks <|nl|> With us to break his neck. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Well, here he comes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Calmly, I do beseech you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece <|nl|> Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods <|nl|> Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice <|nl|> Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's! <|nl|> Throng our large temples with the shows of peace, <|nl|> And not our streets with war! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Amen, amen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> A noble wish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Draw near, ye people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> First, hear me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both Tribunes: <|nl|> Well, say. Peace, ho! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Shall I be charged no further than this present? <|nl|> Must all determine here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> I do demand, <|nl|> If you submit you to the people's voices, <|nl|> Allow their officers and are content <|nl|> To suffer lawful censure for such faults <|nl|> As shall be proved upon you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I am content. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Lo, citizens, he says he is content: <|nl|> The warlike service he has done, consider; think <|nl|> Upon the wounds his body bears, which show <|nl|> Like graves i' the holy churchyard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Scratches with briers, <|nl|> Scars to move laughter only. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Consider further, <|nl|> That when he speaks not like a citizen, <|nl|> You find him like a soldier: do not take <|nl|> His rougher accents for malicious sounds, <|nl|> But, as I say, such as become a soldier, <|nl|> Rather than envy you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Well, well, no more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> What is the matter <|nl|> That being pass'd for consul with full voice, <|nl|> I am so dishonour'd that the very hour <|nl|> You take it off again? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Answer to us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> We charge you, that you have contrived to take <|nl|> From Rome all season'd office and to wind <|nl|> Yourself into a power tyrannical; <|nl|> For which you are a traitor to the people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> How! traitor! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Nay, temperately; your promise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people! <|nl|> Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune! <|nl|> Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths, <|nl|> In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in <|nl|> Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say <|nl|> 'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free <|nl|> As I do pray the gods. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Mark you this, people? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> To the rock, to the rock with him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Peace! <|nl|> We need not put new matter to his charge: <|nl|> What you have seen him do and heard him speak, <|nl|> Beating your officers, cursing yourselves, <|nl|> Opposing laws with strokes and here defying <|nl|> Those whose great power must try him; even this, <|nl|> So criminal and in such capital kind, <|nl|> Deserves the extremest death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> But since he hath <|nl|> Served well for Rome,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> What do you prate of service? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> I talk of that, that know it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> You? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Is this the promise that you made your mother? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Know, I pray you,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I know no further: <|nl|> Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death, <|nl|> Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger <|nl|> But with a grain a day, I would not buy <|nl|> Their mercy at the price of one fair word; <|nl|> Nor cheque my courage for what they can give, <|nl|> To have't with saying 'Good morrow.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> For that he has, <|nl|> As much as in him lies, from time to time <|nl|> Envied against the people, seeking means <|nl|> To pluck away their power, as now at last <|nl|> Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence <|nl|> Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers <|nl|> That do distribute it; in the name o' the people <|nl|> And in the power of us the tribunes, we, <|nl|> Even from this instant, banish him our city, <|nl|> In peril of precipitation <|nl|> From off the rock Tarpeian never more <|nl|> To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name, <|nl|> I say it shall be so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away: <|nl|> He's banish'd, and it shall be so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> He's sentenced; no more hearing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Let me speak: <|nl|> I have been consul, and can show for Rome <|nl|> Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love <|nl|> My country's good with a respect more tender, <|nl|> More holy and profound, than mine own life, <|nl|> My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase, <|nl|> And treasure of my loins; then if I would <|nl|> Speak that,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> We know your drift: speak what? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd, <|nl|> As enemy to the people and his country: <|nl|> It shall be so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> It shall be so, it shall be so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate <|nl|> As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize <|nl|> As the dead carcasses of unburied men <|nl|> That do corrupt my air, I banish you; <|nl|> And here remain with your uncertainty! <|nl|> Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts! <|nl|> Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes, <|nl|> Fan you into despair! Have the power still <|nl|> To banish your defenders; till at length <|nl|> Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, <|nl|> Making not reservation of yourselves, <|nl|> Still your own foes, deliver you as most <|nl|> Abated captives to some nation <|nl|> That won you without blows! Despising, <|nl|> For you, the city, thus I turn my back: <|nl|> There is a world elsewhere. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> The people's enemy is gone, is gone! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Go, see him out at gates, and follow him, <|nl|> As he hath followed you, with all despite; <|nl|> Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard <|nl|> Attend us through the city. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come. <|nl|> The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast <|nl|> With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother, <|nl|> Where is your ancient courage? you were used <|nl|> To say extremity was the trier of spirits; <|nl|> That common chances common men could bear; <|nl|> That when the sea was calm all boats alike <|nl|> Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows, <|nl|> When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves <|nl|> A noble cunning: you were used to load me <|nl|> With precepts that would make invincible <|nl|> The heart that conn'd them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> O heavens! O heavens! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Nay! prithee, woman,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome, <|nl|> And occupations perish! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> What, what, what! <|nl|> I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother. <|nl|> Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say, <|nl|> If you had been the wife of Hercules, <|nl|> Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved <|nl|> Your husband so much sweat. Cominius, <|nl|> Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother: <|nl|> I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius, <|nl|> Thy tears are salter than a younger man's, <|nl|> And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general, <|nl|> I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld <|nl|> Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women <|nl|> 'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes, <|nl|> As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well <|nl|> My hazards still have been your solace: and <|nl|> Believe't not lightly--though I go alone, <|nl|> Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen <|nl|> Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son <|nl|> Will or exceed the common or be caught <|nl|> With cautelous baits and practise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> My first son. <|nl|> Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius <|nl|> With thee awhile: determine on some course, <|nl|> More than a wild exposture to each chance <|nl|> That starts i' the way before thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> O the gods! <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee <|nl|> Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us <|nl|> And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth <|nl|> A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send <|nl|> O'er the vast world to seek a single man, <|nl|> And lose advantage, which doth ever cool <|nl|> I' the absence of the needer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Fare ye well: <|nl|> Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full <|nl|> Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one <|nl|> That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate. <|nl|> Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and <|nl|> My friends of noble touch, when I am forth, <|nl|> Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come. <|nl|> While I remain above the ground, you shall <|nl|> Hear from me still, and never of me aught <|nl|> But what is like me formerly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> That's worthily <|nl|> As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep. <|nl|> If I could shake off but one seven years <|nl|> From these old arms and legs, by the good gods, <|nl|> I'ld with thee every foot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Give me thy hand: Come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further. <|nl|> The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided <|nl|> In his behalf. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Now we have shown our power, <|nl|> Let us seem humbler after it is done <|nl|> Than when it was a-doing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Bid them home: <|nl|> Say their great enemy is gone, and they <|nl|> Stand in their ancient strength. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Dismiss them home. <|nl|> Here comes his mother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Let's not meet her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Why? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> They say she's mad. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods <|nl|> Requite your love! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Peace, peace; be not so loud. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> If that I could for weeping, you should hear,-- <|nl|> Nay, and you shall hear some. <|nl|> Will you be gone? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Are you mankind? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool. <|nl|> Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship <|nl|> To banish him that struck more blows for Rome <|nl|> Than thou hast spoken words? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> O blessed heavens! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> More noble blows than ever thou wise words; <|nl|> And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go: <|nl|> Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son <|nl|> Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him, <|nl|> His good sword in his hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> What then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> What then! <|nl|> He'ld make an end of thy posterity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Bastards and all. <|nl|> Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Come, come, peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> I would he had continued to his country <|nl|> As he began, and not unknit himself <|nl|> The noble knot he made. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> I would he had. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> 'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble: <|nl|> Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth <|nl|> As I can of those mysteries which heaven <|nl|> Will not have earth to know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Pray, let us go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Now, pray, sir, get you gone: <|nl|> You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:-- <|nl|> As far as doth the Capitol exceed <|nl|> The meanest house in Rome, so far my son-- <|nl|> This lady's husband here, this, do you see-- <|nl|> Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Well, well, we'll leave you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Why stay we to be baited <|nl|> With one that wants her wits? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Take my prayers with you. <|nl|> I would the gods had nothing else to do <|nl|> But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em <|nl|> But once a-day, it would unclog my heart <|nl|> Of what lies heavy to't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> You have told them home; <|nl|> And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself, <|nl|> And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go: <|nl|> Leave this faint puling and lament as I do, <|nl|> In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Fie, fie, fie! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> I know you well, sir, and you know <|nl|> me: your name, I think, is Adrian. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Volsce: <|nl|> It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> I am a Roman; and my services are, <|nl|> as you are, against 'em: know you me yet? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Volsce: <|nl|> Nicanor? no. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> The same, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Volsce: <|nl|> You had more beard when I last saw you; but your <|nl|> favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the <|nl|> news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state, <|nl|> to find you out there: you have well saved me a <|nl|> day's journey. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the <|nl|> people against the senators, patricians, and nobles. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Volsce: <|nl|> Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not <|nl|> so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and <|nl|> hope to come upon them in the heat of their division. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing <|nl|> would make it flame again: for the nobles receive <|nl|> so to heart the banishment of that worthy <|nl|> Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take <|nl|> all power from the people and to pluck from them <|nl|> their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can <|nl|> tell you, and is almost mature for the violent <|nl|> breaking out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Volsce: <|nl|> Coriolanus banished! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> Banished, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Volsce: <|nl|> You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> The day serves well for them now. I have heard it <|nl|> said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is <|nl|> when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble <|nl|> Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his <|nl|> great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request <|nl|> of his country. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Volsce: <|nl|> He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus <|nl|> accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my <|nl|> business, and I will merrily accompany you home. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> I shall, between this and supper, tell you most <|nl|> strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of <|nl|> their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Volsce: <|nl|> A most royal one; the centurions and their charges, <|nl|> distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment, <|nl|> and to be on foot at an hour's warning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the <|nl|> man, I think, that shall set them in present action. <|nl|> So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Volsce: <|nl|> You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause <|nl|> to be glad of yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Roman: <|nl|> Well, let us go together. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> A goodly city is this Antium. City, <|nl|> 'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir <|nl|> Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars <|nl|> Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not, <|nl|> Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones <|nl|> In puny battle slay me. <|nl|> Save you, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizen: <|nl|> And you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Direct me, if it be your will, <|nl|> Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizen: <|nl|> He is, and feasts the nobles of the state <|nl|> At his house this night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Which is his house, beseech you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizen: <|nl|> This, here before you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Thank you, sir: farewell. <|nl|> O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn, <|nl|> Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart, <|nl|> Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise, <|nl|> Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love <|nl|> Unseparable, shall within this hour, <|nl|> On a dissension of a doit, break out <|nl|> To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes, <|nl|> Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep, <|nl|> To take the one the other, by some chance, <|nl|> Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends <|nl|> And interjoin their issues. So with me: <|nl|> My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon <|nl|> This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me, <|nl|> He does fair justice; if he give me way, <|nl|> I'll do his country service. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Wine, wine, wine! What service <|nl|> is here! I think our fellows are asleep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Where's Cotus? my master calls <|nl|> for him. Cotus! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I <|nl|> Appear not like a guest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> What would you have, friend? whence are you? <|nl|> Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I have deserved no better entertainment, <|nl|> In being Coriolanus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his <|nl|> head; that he gives entrance to such companions? <|nl|> Pray, get you out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Away! get you away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Now thou'rt troublesome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> What fellow's this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him <|nl|> out of the house: prithee, call my master to him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid <|nl|> the house. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> What are you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> A gentleman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> A marvellous poor one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> True, so I am. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other <|nl|> station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a <|nl|> strange guest he has here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> And I shall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> Where dwellest thou? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Under the canopy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> Under the canopy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Ay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> Where's that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I' the city of kites and crows. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is! <|nl|> Then thou dwellest with daws too? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> No, I serve not thy master. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> How, sir! do you meddle with my master? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy <|nl|> mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy <|nl|> trencher, hence! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Where is this fellow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for <|nl|> disturbing the lords within. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name? <|nl|> Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> If, Tullus, <|nl|> Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not <|nl|> Think me for the man I am, necessity <|nl|> Commands me name myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> What is thy name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, <|nl|> And harsh in sound to thine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Say, what's thy name? <|nl|> Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face <|nl|> Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn. <|nl|> Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st <|nl|> thou me yet? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> I know thee not: thy name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done <|nl|> To thee particularly and to all the Volsces <|nl|> Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may <|nl|> My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service, <|nl|> The extreme dangers and the drops of blood <|nl|> Shed for my thankless country are requited <|nl|> But with that surname; a good memory, <|nl|> And witness of the malice and displeasure <|nl|> Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains; <|nl|> The cruelty and envy of the people, <|nl|> Permitted by our dastard nobles, who <|nl|> Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest; <|nl|> And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be <|nl|> Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity <|nl|> Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope-- <|nl|> Mistake me not--to save my life, for if <|nl|> I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world <|nl|> I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite, <|nl|> To be full quit of those my banishers, <|nl|> Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast <|nl|> A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge <|nl|> Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims <|nl|> Of shame seen through thy country, speed <|nl|> thee straight, <|nl|> And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it <|nl|> That my revengeful services may prove <|nl|> As benefits to thee, for I will fight <|nl|> Against my canker'd country with the spleen <|nl|> Of all the under fiends. But if so be <|nl|> Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes <|nl|> Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am <|nl|> Longer to live most weary, and present <|nl|> My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice; <|nl|> Which not to cut would show thee but a fool, <|nl|> Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate, <|nl|> Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast, <|nl|> And cannot live but to thy shame, unless <|nl|> It be to do thee service. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> O Marcius, Marcius! <|nl|> Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart <|nl|> A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter <|nl|> Should from yond cloud speak divine things, <|nl|> And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more <|nl|> Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine <|nl|> Mine arms about that body, where against <|nl|> My grained ash an hundred times hath broke <|nl|> And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip <|nl|> The anvil of my sword, and do contest <|nl|> As hotly and as nobly with thy love <|nl|> As ever in ambitious strength I did <|nl|> Contend against thy valour. Know thou first, <|nl|> I loved the maid I married; never man <|nl|> Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here, <|nl|> Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart <|nl|> Than when I first my wedded mistress saw <|nl|> Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee, <|nl|> We have a power on foot; and I had purpose <|nl|> Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn, <|nl|> Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out <|nl|> Twelve several times, and I have nightly since <|nl|> Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me; <|nl|> We have been down together in my sleep, <|nl|> Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat, <|nl|> And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius, <|nl|> Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that <|nl|> Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all <|nl|> From twelve to seventy, and pouring war <|nl|> Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, <|nl|> Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in, <|nl|> And take our friendly senators by the hands; <|nl|> Who now are here, taking their leaves of me, <|nl|> Who am prepared against your territories, <|nl|> Though not for Rome itself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> You bless me, gods! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have <|nl|> The leading of thine own revenges, take <|nl|> The one half of my commission; and set down-- <|nl|> As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st <|nl|> Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways; <|nl|> Whether to knock against the gates of Rome, <|nl|> Or rudely visit them in parts remote, <|nl|> To fright them, ere destroy. But come in: <|nl|> Let me commend thee first to those that shall <|nl|> Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes! <|nl|> And more a friend than e'er an enemy; <|nl|> Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Here's a strange alteration! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with <|nl|> a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a <|nl|> false report of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> What an arm he has! he turned me about with his <|nl|> finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in <|nl|> him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I <|nl|> cannot tell how to term it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged, <|nl|> but I thought there was more in him than I could think. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest <|nl|> man i' the world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Who, my master? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Nay, it's no matter for that. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Worth six on him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the <|nl|> greater soldier. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that: <|nl|> for the defence of a town, our general is excellent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Ay, and for an assault too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> What, what, what? let's partake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as <|nl|> lieve be a condemned man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Wherefore? wherefore? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general, <|nl|> Caius Marcius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Why do you say 'thwack our general '? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always <|nl|> good enough for him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too <|nl|> hard for him; I have heard him say so himself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth <|nl|> on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched <|nl|> him like a carbon ado. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> An he had been cannibally given, he might have <|nl|> broiled and eaten him too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> But, more of thy news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son <|nl|> and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no <|nl|> question asked him by any of the senators, but they <|nl|> stand bald before him: our general himself makes a <|nl|> mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and <|nl|> turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But <|nl|> the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i' <|nl|> the middle and but one half of what he was <|nl|> yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty <|nl|> and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says, <|nl|> and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he <|nl|> will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as <|nl|> many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it <|nl|> were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as <|nl|> we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Directitude! what's that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, <|nl|> and the man in blood, they will out of their <|nl|> burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with <|nl|> him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> But when goes this forward? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the <|nl|> drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a <|nl|> parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they <|nl|> wipe their lips. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> Why, then we shall have a stirring world again. <|nl|> This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase <|nl|> tailors, and breed ballad-makers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as <|nl|> day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and <|nl|> full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; <|nl|> mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more <|nl|> bastard children than war's a destroyer of men. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servingman: <|nl|> 'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to <|nl|> be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a <|nl|> great maker of cuckolds. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servingman: <|nl|> Ay, and it makes men hate one another. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servingman: <|nl|> Reason; because they then less need one another. <|nl|> The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap <|nl|> as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> In, in, in, in! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> We hear not of him, neither need we fear him; <|nl|> His remedies are tame i' the present peace <|nl|> And quietness of the people, which before <|nl|> Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends <|nl|> Blush that the world goes well, who rather had, <|nl|> Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold <|nl|> Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see <|nl|> Our tradesmen with in their shops and going <|nl|> About their functions friendly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> We stood to't in good time. <|nl|> Is this Menenius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> 'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both Tribunes: <|nl|> Hail sir! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Hail to you both! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Your Coriolanus <|nl|> Is not much miss'd, but with his friends: <|nl|> The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do, <|nl|> Were he more angry at it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> All's well; and might have been much better, if <|nl|> He could have temporized. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Where is he, hear you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife <|nl|> Hear nothing from him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> The gods preserve you both! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> God-den, our neighbours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> God-den to you all, god-den to you all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees, <|nl|> Are bound to pray for you both. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Live, and thrive! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus <|nl|> Had loved you as we did. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> Now the gods keep you! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both Tribunes: <|nl|> Farewell, farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> This is a happier and more comely time <|nl|> Than when these fellows ran about the streets, <|nl|> Crying confusion. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Caius Marcius was <|nl|> A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent, <|nl|> O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, <|nl|> Self-loving,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> And affecting one sole throne, <|nl|> Without assistance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I think not so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> We should by this, to all our lamentation, <|nl|> If he had gone forth consul, found it so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> The gods have well prevented it, and Rome <|nl|> Sits safe and still without him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AEdile: <|nl|> Worthy tribunes, <|nl|> There is a slave, whom we have put in prison, <|nl|> Reports, the Volsces with two several powers <|nl|> Are enter'd in the Roman territories, <|nl|> And with the deepest malice of the war <|nl|> Destroy what lies before 'em. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> 'Tis Aufidius, <|nl|> Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment, <|nl|> Thrusts forth his horns again into the world; <|nl|> Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome, <|nl|> And durst not once peep out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Come, what talk you <|nl|> Of Marcius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be <|nl|> The Volsces dare break with us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Cannot be! <|nl|> We have record that very well it can, <|nl|> And three examples of the like have been <|nl|> Within my age. But reason with the fellow, <|nl|> Before you punish him, where he heard this, <|nl|> Lest you shall chance to whip your information <|nl|> And beat the messenger who bids beware <|nl|> Of what is to be dreaded. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Tell not me: <|nl|> I know this cannot be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Not possible. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> The nobles in great earnestness are going <|nl|> All to the senate-house: some news is come <|nl|> That turns their countenances. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> 'Tis this slave;-- <|nl|> Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising; <|nl|> Nothing but his report. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Yes, worthy sir, <|nl|> The slave's report is seconded; and more, <|nl|> More fearful, is deliver'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> What more fearful? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> It is spoke freely out of many mouths-- <|nl|> How probable I do not know--that Marcius, <|nl|> Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome, <|nl|> And vows revenge as spacious as between <|nl|> The young'st and oldest thing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> This is most likely! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish <|nl|> Good Marcius home again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> The very trick on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> This is unlikely: <|nl|> He and Aufidius can no more atone <|nl|> Than violentest contrariety. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Messenger: <|nl|> You are sent for to the senate: <|nl|> A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius <|nl|> Associated with Aufidius, rages <|nl|> Upon our territories; and have already <|nl|> O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took <|nl|> What lay before them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> O, you have made good work! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> What news? what news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> You have holp to ravish your own daughters and <|nl|> To melt the city leads upon your pates, <|nl|> To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> What's the news? what's the news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Your temples burned in their cement, and <|nl|> Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined <|nl|> Into an auger's bore. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Pray now, your news? <|nl|> You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?-- <|nl|> If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> If! <|nl|> He is their god: he leads them like a thing <|nl|> Made by some other deity than nature, <|nl|> That shapes man better; and they follow him, <|nl|> Against us brats, with no less confidence <|nl|> Than boys pursuing summer butterflies, <|nl|> Or butchers killing flies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> You have made good work, <|nl|> You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much <|nl|> on the voice of occupation and <|nl|> The breath of garlic-eaters! <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> He will shake <|nl|> Your Rome about your ears. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> As Hercules <|nl|> Did shake down mellow fruit. <|nl|> You have made fair work! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> But is this true, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Ay; and you'll look pale <|nl|> Before you find it other. All the regions <|nl|> Do smilingly revolt; and who resist <|nl|> Are mock'd for valiant ignorance, <|nl|> And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him? <|nl|> Your enemies and his find something in him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> We are all undone, unless <|nl|> The noble man have mercy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Who shall ask it? <|nl|> The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people <|nl|> Deserve such pity of him as the wolf <|nl|> Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they <|nl|> Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even <|nl|> As those should do that had deserved his hate, <|nl|> And therein show'd like enemies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> 'Tis true: <|nl|> If he were putting to my house the brand <|nl|> That should consume it, I have not the face <|nl|> To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands, <|nl|> You and your crafts! you have crafted fair! <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> You have brought <|nl|> A trembling upon Rome, such as was never <|nl|> So incapable of help. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both Tribunes: <|nl|> Say not we brought it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts <|nl|> And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters, <|nl|> Who did hoot him out o' the city. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> But I fear <|nl|> They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius, <|nl|> The second name of men, obeys his points <|nl|> As if he were his officer: desperation <|nl|> Is all the policy, strength and defence, <|nl|> That Rome can make against them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Here come the clusters. <|nl|> And is Aufidius with him? You are they <|nl|> That made the air unwholesome, when you cast <|nl|> Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at <|nl|> Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming; <|nl|> And not a hair upon a soldier's head <|nl|> Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs <|nl|> As you threw caps up will he tumble down, <|nl|> And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter; <|nl|> if he could burn us all into one coal, <|nl|> We have deserved it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Citizens: <|nl|> Faith, we hear fearful news. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> For mine own part, <|nl|> When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> And so did I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very <|nl|> many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and <|nl|> though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet <|nl|> it was against our will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Ye re goodly things, you voices! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> You have made <|nl|> Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> O, ay, what else? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd: <|nl|> These are a side that would be glad to have <|nl|> This true which they so seem to fear. Go home, <|nl|> And show no sign of fear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home. <|nl|> I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished <|nl|> him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> So did we all. But, come, let's home. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> I do not like this news. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Nor I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth <|nl|> Would buy this for a lie! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Pray, let us go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Do they still fly to the Roman? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lieutenant: <|nl|> I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but <|nl|> Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat, <|nl|> Their talk at table, and their thanks at end; <|nl|> And you are darken'd in this action, sir, <|nl|> Even by your own. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> I cannot help it now, <|nl|> Unless, by using means, I lame the foot <|nl|> Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier, <|nl|> Even to my person, than I thought he would <|nl|> When first I did embrace him: yet his nature <|nl|> In that's no changeling; and I must excuse <|nl|> What cannot be amended. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lieutenant: <|nl|> Yet I wish, sir,-- <|nl|> I mean for your particular,--you had not <|nl|> Join'd in commission with him; but either <|nl|> Had borne the action of yourself, or else <|nl|> To him had left it solely. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> I understand thee well; and be thou sure, <|nl|> when he shall come to his account, he knows not <|nl|> What I can urge against him. Although it seems, <|nl|> And so he thinks, and is no less apparent <|nl|> To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly. <|nl|> And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state, <|nl|> Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon <|nl|> As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone <|nl|> That which shall break his neck or hazard mine, <|nl|> Whene'er we come to our account. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lieutenant: <|nl|> Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> All places yield to him ere he sits down; <|nl|> And the nobility of Rome are his: <|nl|> The senators and patricians love him too: <|nl|> The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people <|nl|> Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty <|nl|> To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome <|nl|> As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it <|nl|> By sovereignty of nature. First he was <|nl|> A noble servant to them; but he could not <|nl|> Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride, <|nl|> Which out of daily fortune ever taints <|nl|> The happy man; whether defect of judgment, <|nl|> To fail in the disposing of those chances <|nl|> Which he was lord of; or whether nature, <|nl|> Not to be other than one thing, not moving <|nl|> From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace <|nl|> Even with the same austerity and garb <|nl|> As he controll'd the war; but one of these-- <|nl|> As he hath spices of them all, not all, <|nl|> For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd, <|nl|> So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit, <|nl|> To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues <|nl|> Lie in the interpretation of the time: <|nl|> And power, unto itself most commendable, <|nl|> Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair <|nl|> To extol what it hath done. <|nl|> One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail; <|nl|> Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail. <|nl|> Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine, <|nl|> Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said <|nl|> Which was sometime his general; who loved him <|nl|> In a most dear particular. He call'd me father: <|nl|> But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him; <|nl|> A mile before his tent fall down, and knee <|nl|> The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd <|nl|> To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> He would not seem to know me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Do you hear? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> Yet one time he did call me by my name: <|nl|> I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops <|nl|> That we have bled together. Coriolanus <|nl|> He would not answer to: forbad all names; <|nl|> He was a kind of nothing, titleless, <|nl|> Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire <|nl|> Of burning Rome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Why, so: you have made good work! <|nl|> A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome, <|nl|> To make coals cheap,--a noble memory! <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon <|nl|> When it was less expected: he replied, <|nl|> It was a bare petition of a state <|nl|> To one whom they had punish'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Very well: <|nl|> Could he say less? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> I offer'd to awaken his regard <|nl|> For's private friends: his answer to me was, <|nl|> He could not stay to pick them in a pile <|nl|> Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly, <|nl|> For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt, <|nl|> And still to nose the offence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> For one poor grain or two! <|nl|> I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child, <|nl|> And this brave fellow too, we are the grains: <|nl|> You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt <|nl|> Above the moon: we must be burnt for you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid <|nl|> In this so never-needed help, yet do not <|nl|> Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you <|nl|> Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, <|nl|> More than the instant army we can make, <|nl|> Might stop our countryman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> No, I'll not meddle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Pray you, go to him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> What should I do? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> Only make trial what your love can do <|nl|> For Rome, towards Marcius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Well, and say that Marcius <|nl|> Return me, as Cominius is return'd, <|nl|> Unheard; what then? <|nl|> But as a discontented friend, grief-shot <|nl|> With his unkindness? say't be so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Yet your good will <|nl|> must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure <|nl|> As you intended well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I'll undertake 't: <|nl|> I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip <|nl|> And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me. <|nl|> He was not taken well; he had not dined: <|nl|> The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then <|nl|> We pout upon the morning, are unapt <|nl|> To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd <|nl|> These and these conveyances of our blood <|nl|> With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls <|nl|> Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him <|nl|> Till he be dieted to my request, <|nl|> And then I'll set upon him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRUTUS: <|nl|> You know the very road into his kindness, <|nl|> And cannot lose your way. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Good faith, I'll prove him, <|nl|> Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge <|nl|> Of my success. <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> He'll never hear him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> COMINIUS: <|nl|> I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye <|nl|> Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury <|nl|> The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him; <|nl|> 'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me <|nl|> Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do, <|nl|> He sent in writing after me; what he would not, <|nl|> Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions: <|nl|> So that all hope is vain. <|nl|> Unless his noble mother, and his wife; <|nl|> Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him <|nl|> For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence, <|nl|> And with our fair entreaties haste them on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Stay: whence are you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> Stand, and go back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave, <|nl|> I am an officer of state, and come <|nl|> To speak with Coriolanus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> From whence? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> From Rome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> You may not pass, you must return: our general <|nl|> Will no more hear from thence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before <|nl|> You'll speak with Coriolanus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Good my friends, <|nl|> If you have heard your general talk of Rome, <|nl|> And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks, <|nl|> My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name <|nl|> Is not here passable. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I tell thee, fellow, <|nl|> The general is my lover: I have been <|nl|> The book of his good acts, whence men have read <|nl|> His name unparallel'd, haply amplified; <|nl|> For I have ever verified my friends, <|nl|> Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity <|nl|> Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes, <|nl|> Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground, <|nl|> I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise <|nl|> Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow, <|nl|> I must have leave to pass. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his <|nl|> behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you <|nl|> should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous <|nl|> to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius, <|nl|> always factionary on the party of your general. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you <|nl|> have, I am one that, telling true under him, must <|nl|> say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not <|nl|> speak with him till after dinner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> You are a Roman, are you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I am, as thy general is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you, <|nl|> when you have pushed out your gates the very <|nl|> defender of them, and, in a violent popular <|nl|> ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to <|nl|> front his revenges with the easy groans of old <|nl|> women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with <|nl|> the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as <|nl|> you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the <|nl|> intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with <|nl|> such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived; <|nl|> therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your <|nl|> execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn <|nl|> you out of reprieve and pardon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would <|nl|> use me with estimation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> Come, my captain knows you not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I mean, thy general. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest <|nl|> I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's <|nl|> the utmost of your having: back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Nay, but, fellow, fellow,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> What's the matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you: <|nl|> You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall <|nl|> perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from <|nl|> my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment <|nl|> with him, if thou standest not i' the state of <|nl|> hanging, or of some death more long in <|nl|> spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now <|nl|> presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee. <|nl|> The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy <|nl|> particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than <|nl|> thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son! <|nl|> thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's <|nl|> water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to <|nl|> thee; but being assured none but myself could move <|nl|> thee, I have been blown out of your gates with <|nl|> sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy <|nl|> petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy <|nl|> wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet <|nl|> here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my <|nl|> access to thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> How! away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs <|nl|> Are servanted to others: though I owe <|nl|> My revenge properly, my remission lies <|nl|> In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar, <|nl|> Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather <|nl|> Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone. <|nl|> Mine ears against your suits are stronger than <|nl|> Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee, <|nl|> Take this along; I writ it for thy sake <|nl|> And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius, <|nl|> I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius, <|nl|> Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> You keep a constant temper. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Now, sir, is your name Menenius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> 'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the <|nl|> way home again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your <|nl|> greatness back? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> What cause, do you think, I have to swoon? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I neither care for the world nor your general: for <|nl|> such things as you, I can scarce think there's any, <|nl|> ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by <|nl|> himself fears it not from another: let your general <|nl|> do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and <|nl|> your misery increase with your age! I say to you, <|nl|> as I was said to, Away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> A noble fellow, I warrant him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Senator: <|nl|> The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the <|nl|> oak not to be wind-shaken. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow <|nl|> Set down our host. My partner in this action, <|nl|> You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly <|nl|> I have borne this business. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Only their ends <|nl|> You have respected; stopp'd your ears against <|nl|> The general suit of Rome; never admitted <|nl|> A private whisper, no, not with such friends <|nl|> That thought them sure of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> This last old man, <|nl|> Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome, <|nl|> Loved me above the measure of a father; <|nl|> Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge <|nl|> Was to send him; for whose old love I have, <|nl|> Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd <|nl|> The first conditions, which they did refuse <|nl|> And cannot now accept; to grace him only <|nl|> That thought he could do more, a very little <|nl|> I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits, <|nl|> Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter <|nl|> Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this? <|nl|> Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow <|nl|> In the same time 'tis made? I will not. <|nl|> My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould <|nl|> Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand <|nl|> The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection! <|nl|> All bond and privilege of nature, break! <|nl|> Let it be virtuous to be obstinate. <|nl|> What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes, <|nl|> Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not <|nl|> Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows; <|nl|> As if Olympus to a molehill should <|nl|> In supplication nod: and my young boy <|nl|> Hath an aspect of intercession, which <|nl|> Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces <|nl|> Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never <|nl|> Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand, <|nl|> As if a man were author of himself <|nl|> And knew no other kin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> My lord and husband! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> The sorrow that delivers us thus changed <|nl|> Makes you think so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Like a dull actor now, <|nl|> I have forgot my part, and I am out, <|nl|> Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh, <|nl|> Forgive my tyranny; but do not say <|nl|> For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss <|nl|> Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge! <|nl|> Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss <|nl|> I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip <|nl|> Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate, <|nl|> And the most noble mother of the world <|nl|> Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth; <|nl|> Of thy deep duty more impression show <|nl|> Than that of common sons. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> O, stand up blest! <|nl|> Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint, <|nl|> I kneel before thee; and unproperly <|nl|> Show duty, as mistaken all this while <|nl|> Between the child and parent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> What is this? <|nl|> Your knees to me? to your corrected son? <|nl|> Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach <|nl|> Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds <|nl|> Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun; <|nl|> Murdering impossibility, to make <|nl|> What cannot be, slight work. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Thou art my warrior; <|nl|> I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> The noble sister of Publicola, <|nl|> The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle <|nl|> That's curdied by the frost from purest snow <|nl|> And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> This is a poor epitome of yours, <|nl|> Which by the interpretation of full time <|nl|> May show like all yourself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> The god of soldiers, <|nl|> With the consent of supreme Jove, inform <|nl|> Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove <|nl|> To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars <|nl|> Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw, <|nl|> And saving those that eye thee! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Your knee, sirrah. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> That's my brave boy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself, <|nl|> Are suitors to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I beseech you, peace: <|nl|> Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before: <|nl|> The thing I have forsworn to grant may never <|nl|> Be held by you denials. Do not bid me <|nl|> Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate <|nl|> Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not <|nl|> Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not <|nl|> To ally my rages and revenges with <|nl|> Your colder reasons. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> O, no more, no more! <|nl|> You have said you will not grant us any thing; <|nl|> For we have nothing else to ask, but that <|nl|> Which you deny already: yet we will ask; <|nl|> That, if you fail in our request, the blame <|nl|> May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll <|nl|> Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment <|nl|> And state of bodies would bewray what life <|nl|> We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself <|nl|> How more unfortunate than all living women <|nl|> Are we come hither: since that thy sight, <|nl|> which should <|nl|> Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance <|nl|> with comforts, <|nl|> Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow; <|nl|> Making the mother, wife and child to see <|nl|> The son, the husband and the father tearing <|nl|> His country's bowels out. And to poor we <|nl|> Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us <|nl|> Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort <|nl|> That all but we enjoy; for how can we, <|nl|> Alas, how can we for our country pray. <|nl|> Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory, <|nl|> Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose <|nl|> The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person, <|nl|> Our comfort in the country. We must find <|nl|> An evident calamity, though we had <|nl|> Our wish, which side should win: for either thou <|nl|> Must, as a foreign recreant, be led <|nl|> With manacles thorough our streets, or else <|nl|> triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin, <|nl|> And bear the palm for having bravely shed <|nl|> Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son, <|nl|> I purpose not to wait on fortune till <|nl|> These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee <|nl|> Rather to show a noble grace to both parts <|nl|> Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner <|nl|> March to assault thy country than to tread-- <|nl|> Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb, <|nl|> That brought thee to this world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VIRGILIA: <|nl|> Ay, and mine, <|nl|> That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name <|nl|> Living to time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Young MARCIUS: <|nl|> A' shall not tread on me; <|nl|> I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Not of a woman's tenderness to be, <|nl|> Requires nor child nor woman's face to see. <|nl|> I have sat too long. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VOLUMNIA: <|nl|> Nay, go not from us thus. <|nl|> If it were so that our request did tend <|nl|> To save the Romans, thereby to destroy <|nl|> The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us, <|nl|> As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit <|nl|> Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces <|nl|> May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans, <|nl|> 'This we received;' and each in either side <|nl|> Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest <|nl|> For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son, <|nl|> The end of war's uncertain, but this certain, <|nl|> That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit <|nl|> Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name, <|nl|> Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses; <|nl|> Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble, <|nl|> But with his last attempt he wiped it out; <|nl|> Destroy'd his country, and his name remains <|nl|> To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son: <|nl|> Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour, <|nl|> To imitate the graces of the gods; <|nl|> To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air, <|nl|> And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt <|nl|> That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak? <|nl|> Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man <|nl|> Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you: <|nl|> He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy: <|nl|> Perhaps thy childishness will move him more <|nl|> Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world <|nl|> More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate <|nl|> Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life <|nl|> Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy, <|nl|> When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood, <|nl|> Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home, <|nl|> Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust, <|nl|> And spurn me back: but if it be not so, <|nl|> Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee, <|nl|> That thou restrain'st from me the duty which <|nl|> To a mother's part belongs. He turns away: <|nl|> Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees. <|nl|> To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride <|nl|> Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end; <|nl|> This is the last: so we will home to Rome, <|nl|> And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's: <|nl|> This boy, that cannot tell what he would have <|nl|> But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship, <|nl|> Does reason our petition with more strength <|nl|> Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go: <|nl|> This fellow had a Volscian to his mother; <|nl|> His wife is in Corioli and his child <|nl|> Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch: <|nl|> I am hush'd until our city be a-fire, <|nl|> And then I'll speak a little. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> O mother, mother! <|nl|> What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope, <|nl|> The gods look down, and this unnatural scene <|nl|> They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O! <|nl|> You have won a happy victory to Rome; <|nl|> But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it, <|nl|> Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd, <|nl|> If not most mortal to him. But, let it come. <|nl|> Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, <|nl|> I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius, <|nl|> Were you in my stead, would you have heard <|nl|> A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> I was moved withal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> I dare be sworn you were: <|nl|> And, sir, it is no little thing to make <|nl|> Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir, <|nl|> What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part, <|nl|> I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you, <|nl|> Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Ay, by and by; <|nl|> But we will drink together; and you shall bear <|nl|> A better witness back than words, which we, <|nl|> On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd. <|nl|> Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve <|nl|> To have a temple built you: all the swords <|nl|> In Italy, and her confederate arms, <|nl|> Could not have made this peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond <|nl|> corner-stone? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Why, what of that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> If it be possible for you to displace it with your <|nl|> little finger, there is some hope the ladies of <|nl|> Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him. <|nl|> But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are <|nl|> sentenced and stay upon execution. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Is't possible that so short a time can alter the <|nl|> condition of a man! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> There is differency between a grub and a butterfly; <|nl|> yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown <|nl|> from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a <|nl|> creeping thing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> He loved his mother dearly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother <|nl|> now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness <|nl|> of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he <|nl|> moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before <|nl|> his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with <|nl|> his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a <|nl|> battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for <|nl|> Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with <|nl|> his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity <|nl|> and a heaven to throne in. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Yes, mercy, if you report him truly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his <|nl|> mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy <|nl|> in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that <|nl|> shall our poor city find: and all this is long of <|nl|> you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> The gods be good unto us! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto <|nl|> us. When we banished him, we respected not them; <|nl|> and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house: <|nl|> The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune <|nl|> And hale him up and down, all swearing, if <|nl|> The Roman ladies bring not comfort home, <|nl|> They'll give him death by inches. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> What's the news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Messenger: <|nl|> Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd, <|nl|> The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone: <|nl|> A merrier day did never yet greet Rome, <|nl|> No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> Friend, <|nl|> Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Messenger: <|nl|> As certain as I know the sun is fire: <|nl|> Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it? <|nl|> Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide, <|nl|> As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you! <|nl|> The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes, <|nl|> Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans, <|nl|> Make the sun dance. Hark you! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MENENIUS: <|nl|> This is good news: <|nl|> I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia <|nl|> Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians, <|nl|> A city full; of tribunes, such as you, <|nl|> A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day: <|nl|> This morning for ten thousand of your throats <|nl|> I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next, <|nl|> Accept my thankfulness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Messenger: <|nl|> Sir, we have all <|nl|> Great cause to give great thanks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> They are near the city? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Messenger: <|nl|> Almost at point to enter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SICINIUS: <|nl|> We will meet them, <|nl|> And help the joy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Senator: <|nl|> Behold our patroness, the life of Rome! <|nl|> Call all your tribes together, praise the gods, <|nl|> And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them: <|nl|> Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius, <|nl|> Repeal him with the welcome of his mother; <|nl|> Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!' <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Welcome, ladies, Welcome! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Go tell the lords o' the city I am here: <|nl|> Deliver them this paper: having read it, <|nl|> Bid them repair to the market place; where I, <|nl|> Even in theirs and in the commons' ears, <|nl|> Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse <|nl|> The city ports by this hath enter'd and <|nl|> Intends to appear before the people, hoping <|nl|> To purge herself with words: dispatch. <|nl|> Most welcome! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Conspirator: <|nl|> How is it with our general? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Even so <|nl|> As with a man by his own alms empoison'd, <|nl|> And with his charity slain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Conspirator: <|nl|> Most noble sir, <|nl|> If you do hold the same intent wherein <|nl|> You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you <|nl|> Of your great danger. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Sir, I cannot tell: <|nl|> We must proceed as we do find the people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Conspirator: <|nl|> The people will remain uncertain whilst <|nl|> 'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either <|nl|> Makes the survivor heir of all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> I know it; <|nl|> And my pretext to strike at him admits <|nl|> A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd <|nl|> Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd, <|nl|> He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery, <|nl|> Seducing so my friends; and, to this end, <|nl|> He bow'd his nature, never known before <|nl|> But to be rough, unswayable and free. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Conspirator: <|nl|> Sir, his stoutness <|nl|> When he did stand for consul, which he lost <|nl|> By lack of stooping,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> That I would have spoke of: <|nl|> Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth; <|nl|> Presented to my knife his throat: I took him; <|nl|> Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way <|nl|> In all his own desires; nay, let him choose <|nl|> Out of my files, his projects to accomplish, <|nl|> My best and freshest men; served his designments <|nl|> In mine own person; holp to reap the fame <|nl|> Which he did end all his; and took some pride <|nl|> To do myself this wrong: till, at the last, <|nl|> I seem'd his follower, not partner, and <|nl|> He waged me with his countenance, as if <|nl|> I had been mercenary. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Conspirator: <|nl|> So he did, my lord: <|nl|> The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last, <|nl|> When he had carried Rome and that we look'd <|nl|> For no less spoil than glory,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> There was it: <|nl|> For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him. <|nl|> At a few drops of women's rheum, which are <|nl|> As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour <|nl|> Of our great action: therefore shall he die, <|nl|> And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Conspirator: <|nl|> Your native town you enter'd like a post, <|nl|> And had no welcomes home: but he returns, <|nl|> Splitting the air with noise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Conspirator: <|nl|> And patient fools, <|nl|> Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear <|nl|> With giving him glory. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Conspirator: <|nl|> Therefore, at your vantage, <|nl|> Ere he express himself, or move the people <|nl|> With what he would say, let him feel your sword, <|nl|> Which we will second. When he lies along, <|nl|> After your way his tale pronounced shall bury <|nl|> His reasons with his body. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Say no more: <|nl|> Here come the lords. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All The Lords: <|nl|> You are most welcome home. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> I have not deserved it. <|nl|> But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused <|nl|> What I have written to you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lords: <|nl|> We have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> And grieve to hear't. <|nl|> What faults he made before the last, I think <|nl|> Might have found easy fines: but there to end <|nl|> Where he was to begin and give away <|nl|> The benefit of our levies, answering us <|nl|> With our own charge, making a treaty where <|nl|> There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> He approaches: you shall hear him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier, <|nl|> No more infected with my country's love <|nl|> Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting <|nl|> Under your great command. You are to know <|nl|> That prosperously I have attempted and <|nl|> With bloody passage led your wars even to <|nl|> The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home <|nl|> Do more than counterpoise a full third part <|nl|> The charges of the action. We have made peace <|nl|> With no less honour to the Antiates <|nl|> Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver, <|nl|> Subscribed by the consuls and patricians, <|nl|> Together with the seal o' the senate, what <|nl|> We have compounded on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Read it not, noble lords; <|nl|> But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree <|nl|> He hath abused your powers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Traitor! how now! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Ay, traitor, Marcius! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Marcius! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think <|nl|> I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name <|nl|> Coriolanus in Corioli? <|nl|> You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously <|nl|> He has betray'd your business, and given up, <|nl|> For certain drops of salt, your city Rome, <|nl|> I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother; <|nl|> Breaking his oath and resolution like <|nl|> A twist of rotten silk, never admitting <|nl|> Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears <|nl|> He whined and roar'd away your victory, <|nl|> That pages blush'd at him and men of heart <|nl|> Look'd wondering each at other. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Hear'st thou, Mars? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Name not the god, thou boy of tears! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Ha! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> No more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart <|nl|> Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave! <|nl|> Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever <|nl|> I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords, <|nl|> Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion-- <|nl|> Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that <|nl|> Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join <|nl|> To thrust the lie unto him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> Peace, both, and hear me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads, <|nl|> Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound! <|nl|> If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there, <|nl|> That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I <|nl|> Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli: <|nl|> Alone I did it. Boy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Why, noble lords, <|nl|> Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune, <|nl|> Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart, <|nl|> 'Fore your own eyes and ears? <|nl|>  <|nl|> All Conspirators: <|nl|> Let him die for't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All The People: <|nl|> 'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd <|nl|> my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin <|nl|> Marcus.' 'He killed my father.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Lord: <|nl|> Peace, ho! no outrage: peace! <|nl|> The man is noble and his fame folds-in <|nl|> This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us <|nl|> Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius, <|nl|> And trouble not the peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CORIOLANUS: <|nl|> O that I had him, <|nl|> With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe, <|nl|> To use my lawful sword! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> Insolent villain! <|nl|>  <|nl|> All Conspirators: <|nl|> Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lords: <|nl|> Hold, hold, hold, hold! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> My noble masters, hear me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> O Tullus,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Lord: <|nl|> Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Lord: <|nl|> Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet; <|nl|> Put up your swords. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage, <|nl|> Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger <|nl|> Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice <|nl|> That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours <|nl|> To call me to your senate, I'll deliver <|nl|> Myself your loyal servant, or endure <|nl|> Your heaviest censure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> Bear from hence his body; <|nl|> And mourn you for him: let him be regarded <|nl|> As the most noble corse that ever herald <|nl|> Did follow to his urn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Lord: <|nl|> His own impatience <|nl|> Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame. <|nl|> Let's make the best of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUFIDIUS: <|nl|> My rage is gone; <|nl|> And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up. <|nl|> Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one. <|nl|> Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully: <|nl|> Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he <|nl|> Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one, <|nl|> Which to this hour bewail the injury, <|nl|> Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Now is the winter of our discontent <|nl|> Made glorious summer by this sun of York; <|nl|> And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house <|nl|> In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. <|nl|> Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; <|nl|> Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; <|nl|> Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, <|nl|> Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. <|nl|> Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front; <|nl|> And now, instead of mounting barded steeds <|nl|> To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, <|nl|> He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber <|nl|> To the lascivious pleasing of a lute. <|nl|> But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks, <|nl|> Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass; <|nl|> I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty <|nl|> To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; <|nl|> I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, <|nl|> Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, <|nl|> Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time <|nl|> Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, <|nl|> And that so lamely and unfashionable <|nl|> That dogs bark at me as I halt by them; <|nl|> Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, <|nl|> Have no delight to pass away the time, <|nl|> Unless to spy my shadow in the sun <|nl|> And descant on mine own deformity: <|nl|> And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, <|nl|> To entertain these fair well-spoken days, <|nl|> I am determined to prove a villain <|nl|> And hate the idle pleasures of these days. <|nl|> Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, <|nl|> By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams, <|nl|> To set my brother Clarence and the king <|nl|> In deadly hate the one against the other: <|nl|> And if King Edward be as true and just <|nl|> As I am subtle, false and treacherous, <|nl|> This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up, <|nl|> About a prophecy, which says that 'G' <|nl|> Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be. <|nl|> Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here <|nl|> Clarence comes. <|nl|> Brother, good day; what means this armed guard <|nl|> That waits upon your grace? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> His majesty <|nl|> Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed <|nl|> This conduct to convey me to the Tower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Upon what cause? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Because my name is George. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours; <|nl|> He should, for that, commit your godfathers: <|nl|> O, belike his majesty hath some intent <|nl|> That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower. <|nl|> But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest <|nl|> As yet I do not: but, as I can learn, <|nl|> He hearkens after prophecies and dreams; <|nl|> And from the cross-row plucks the letter G. <|nl|> And says a wizard told him that by G <|nl|> His issue disinherited should be; <|nl|> And, for my name of George begins with G, <|nl|> It follows in his thought that I am he. <|nl|> These, as I learn, and such like toys as these <|nl|> Have moved his highness to commit me now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women: <|nl|> 'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower: <|nl|> My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she <|nl|> That tempers him to this extremity. <|nl|> Was it not she and that good man of worship, <|nl|> Anthony Woodville, her brother there, <|nl|> That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower, <|nl|> From whence this present day he is deliver'd? <|nl|> We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> By heaven, I think there's no man is secure <|nl|> But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds <|nl|> That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore. <|nl|> Heard ye not what an humble suppliant <|nl|> Lord hastings was to her for his delivery? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Humbly complaining to her deity <|nl|> Got my lord chamberlain his liberty. <|nl|> I'll tell you what; I think it is our way, <|nl|> If we will keep in favour with the king, <|nl|> To be her men and wear her livery: <|nl|> The jealous o'erworn widow and herself, <|nl|> Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen. <|nl|> Are mighty gossips in this monarchy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> I beseech your graces both to pardon me; <|nl|> His majesty hath straitly given in charge <|nl|> That no man shall have private conference, <|nl|> Of what degree soever, with his brother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury, <|nl|> You may partake of any thing we say: <|nl|> We speak no treason, man: we say the king <|nl|> Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen <|nl|> Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous; <|nl|> We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot, <|nl|> A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue; <|nl|> And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks: <|nl|> How say you sir? Can you deny all this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> With this, my lord, myself have nought to do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow, <|nl|> He that doth naught with her, excepting one, <|nl|> Were best he do it secretly, alone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> What one, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal <|nl|> Forbear your conference with the noble duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> We are the queen's abjects, and must obey. <|nl|> Brother, farewell: I will unto the king; <|nl|> And whatsoever you will employ me in, <|nl|> Were it to call King Edward's widow sister, <|nl|> I will perform it to enfranchise you. <|nl|> Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood <|nl|> Touches me deeper than you can imagine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> I know it pleaseth neither of us well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Well, your imprisonment shall not be long; <|nl|> Meantime, have patience. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> I must perforce. Farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return. <|nl|> Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so, <|nl|> That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven, <|nl|> If heaven will take the present at our hands. <|nl|> But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Good time of day unto my gracious lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> As much unto my good lord chamberlain! <|nl|> Well are you welcome to the open air. <|nl|> How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must: <|nl|> But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks <|nl|> That were the cause of my imprisonment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too; <|nl|> For they that were your enemies are his, <|nl|> And have prevail'd as much on him as you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> More pity that the eagle should be mew'd, <|nl|> While kites and buzzards prey at liberty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> What news abroad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> No news so bad abroad as this at home; <|nl|> The King is sickly, weak and melancholy, <|nl|> And his physicians fear him mightily. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed. <|nl|> O, he hath kept an evil diet long, <|nl|> And overmuch consumed his royal person: <|nl|> 'Tis very grievous to be thought upon. <|nl|> What, is he in his bed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> He is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Go you before, and I will follow you. <|nl|> He cannot live, I hope; and must not die <|nl|> Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven. <|nl|> I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence, <|nl|> With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments; <|nl|> And, if I fall not in my deep intent, <|nl|> Clarence hath not another day to live: <|nl|> Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy, <|nl|> And leave the world for me to bustle in! <|nl|> For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter. <|nl|> What though I kill'd her husband and her father? <|nl|> The readiest way to make the wench amends <|nl|> Is to become her husband and her father: <|nl|> The which will I; not all so much for love <|nl|> As for another secret close intent, <|nl|> By marrying her which I must reach unto. <|nl|> But yet I run before my horse to market: <|nl|> Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns: <|nl|> When they are gone, then must I count my gains. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Set down, set down your honourable load, <|nl|> If honour may be shrouded in a hearse, <|nl|> Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament <|nl|> The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster. <|nl|> Poor key-cold figure of a holy king! <|nl|> Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster! <|nl|> Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood! <|nl|> Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost, <|nl|> To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne, <|nl|> Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son, <|nl|> Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds! <|nl|> Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life, <|nl|> I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes. <|nl|> Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes! <|nl|> Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it! <|nl|> Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence! <|nl|> More direful hap betide that hated wretch, <|nl|> That makes us wretched by the death of thee, <|nl|> Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads, <|nl|> Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives! <|nl|> If ever he have child, abortive be it, <|nl|> Prodigious, and untimely brought to light, <|nl|> Whose ugly and unnatural aspect <|nl|> May fright the hopeful mother at the view; <|nl|> And that be heir to his unhappiness! <|nl|> If ever he have wife, let her he made <|nl|> A miserable by the death of him <|nl|> As I am made by my poor lord and thee! <|nl|> Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load, <|nl|> Taken from Paul's to be interred there; <|nl|> And still, as you are weary of the weight, <|nl|> Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> What black magician conjures up this fiend, <|nl|> To stop devoted charitable deeds? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul, <|nl|> I'll make a corse of him that disobeys. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gentleman: <|nl|> My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command: <|nl|> Advance thy halbert higher than my breast, <|nl|> Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot, <|nl|> And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> What, do you tremble? are you all afraid? <|nl|> Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal, <|nl|> And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil. <|nl|> Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell! <|nl|> Thou hadst but power over his mortal body, <|nl|> His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not; <|nl|> For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell, <|nl|> Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims. <|nl|> If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds, <|nl|> Behold this pattern of thy butcheries. <|nl|> O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds <|nl|> Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh! <|nl|> Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity; <|nl|> For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood <|nl|> From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells; <|nl|> Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural, <|nl|> Provokes this deluge most unnatural. <|nl|> O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death! <|nl|> O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death! <|nl|> Either heaven with lightning strike the <|nl|> murderer dead, <|nl|> Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick, <|nl|> As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood <|nl|> Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Lady, you know no rules of charity, <|nl|> Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man: <|nl|> No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> But I know none, and therefore am no beast. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> O wonderful, when devils tell the truth! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> More wonderful, when angels are so angry. <|nl|> Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman, <|nl|> Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave, <|nl|> By circumstance, but to acquit myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man, <|nl|> For these known evils, but to give me leave, <|nl|> By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have <|nl|> Some patient leisure to excuse myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make <|nl|> No excuse current, but to hang thyself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> By such despair, I should accuse myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused; <|nl|> For doing worthy vengeance on thyself, <|nl|> Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Say that I slew them not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Why, then they are not dead: <|nl|> But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I did not kill your husband. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Why, then he is alive. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw <|nl|> Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood; <|nl|> The which thou once didst bend against her breast, <|nl|> But that thy brothers beat aside the point. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I was provoked by her slanderous tongue, <|nl|> which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind. <|nl|> Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries: <|nl|> Didst thou not kill this king? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I grant ye. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too <|nl|> Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed! <|nl|> O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither; <|nl|> For he was fitter for that place than earth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> And thou unfit for any place but hell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Some dungeon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Your bed-chamber. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> So will it, madam till I lie with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> I hope so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne, <|nl|> To leave this keen encounter of our wits, <|nl|> And fall somewhat into a slower method, <|nl|> Is not the causer of the timeless deaths <|nl|> Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward, <|nl|> As blameful as the executioner? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Your beauty was the cause of that effect; <|nl|> Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep <|nl|> To undertake the death of all the world, <|nl|> So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide, <|nl|> These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck; <|nl|> You should not blemish it, if I stood by: <|nl|> As all the world is cheered by the sun, <|nl|> So I by that; it is my day, my life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> I would I were, to be revenged on thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> It is a quarrel most unnatural, <|nl|> To be revenged on him that loveth you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> It is a quarrel just and reasonable, <|nl|> To be revenged on him that slew my husband. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband, <|nl|> Did it to help thee to a better husband. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> His better doth not breathe upon the earth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> He lives that loves thee better than he could. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Name him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Plantagenet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Why, that was he. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> The selfsame name, but one of better nature. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Where is he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Here. <|nl|> Why dost thou spit at me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Never came poison from so sweet a place. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Never hung poison on a fouler toad. <|nl|> Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I would they were, that I might die at once; <|nl|> For now they kill me with a living death. <|nl|> Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears, <|nl|> Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops: <|nl|> These eyes that never shed remorseful tear, <|nl|> No, when my father York and Edward wept, <|nl|> To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made <|nl|> When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him; <|nl|> Nor when thy warlike father, like a child, <|nl|> Told the sad story of my father's death, <|nl|> And twenty times made pause to sob and weep, <|nl|> That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks <|nl|> Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time <|nl|> My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear; <|nl|> And what these sorrows could not thence exhale, <|nl|> Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping. <|nl|> I never sued to friend nor enemy; <|nl|> My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word; <|nl|> But now thy beauty is proposed my fee, <|nl|> My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak. <|nl|> Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made <|nl|> For kissing, lady, not for such contempt. <|nl|> If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive, <|nl|> Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword; <|nl|> Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom. <|nl|> And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, <|nl|> I lay it naked to the deadly stroke, <|nl|> And humbly beg the death upon my knee. <|nl|> Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry, <|nl|> But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me. <|nl|> Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward, <|nl|> But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on. <|nl|> Take up the sword again, or take up me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death, <|nl|> I will not be the executioner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> I have already. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Tush, that was in thy rage: <|nl|> Speak it again, and, even with the word, <|nl|> That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love, <|nl|> Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love; <|nl|> To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> I would I knew thy heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> 'Tis figured in my tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> I fear me both are false. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Then never man was true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Well, well, put up your sword. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Say, then, my peace is made. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> That shall you know hereafter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> But shall I live in hope? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> All men, I hope, live so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Vouchsafe to wear this ring. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> To take is not to give. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Look, how this ring encompasseth finger. <|nl|> Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart; <|nl|> Wear both of them, for both of them are thine. <|nl|> And if thy poor devoted suppliant may <|nl|> But beg one favour at thy gracious hand, <|nl|> Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> What is it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> That it would please thee leave these sad designs <|nl|> To him that hath more cause to be a mourner, <|nl|> And presently repair to Crosby Place; <|nl|> Where, after I have solemnly interr'd <|nl|> At Chertsey monastery this noble king, <|nl|> And wet his grave with my repentant tears, <|nl|> I will with all expedient duty see you: <|nl|> For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you, <|nl|> Grant me this boon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> With all my heart; and much it joys me too, <|nl|> To see you are become so penitent. <|nl|> Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Bid me farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> 'Tis more than you deserve; <|nl|> But since you teach me how to flatter you, <|nl|> Imagine I have said farewell already. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Sirs, take up the corse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GENTLEMEN: <|nl|> Towards Chertsey, noble lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining. <|nl|> Was ever woman in this humour woo'd? <|nl|> Was ever woman in this humour won? <|nl|> I'll have her; but I will not keep her long. <|nl|> What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father, <|nl|> To take her in her heart's extremest hate, <|nl|> With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes, <|nl|> The bleeding witness of her hatred by; <|nl|> Having God, her conscience, and these bars <|nl|> against me, <|nl|> And I nothing to back my suit at all, <|nl|> But the plain devil and dissembling looks, <|nl|> And yet to win her, all the world to nothing! <|nl|> Ha! <|nl|> Hath she forgot already that brave prince, <|nl|> Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since, <|nl|> Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury? <|nl|> A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman, <|nl|> Framed in the prodigality of nature, <|nl|> Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal, <|nl|> The spacious world cannot again afford <|nl|> And will she yet debase her eyes on me, <|nl|> That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince, <|nl|> And made her widow to a woful bed? <|nl|> On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety? <|nl|> On me, that halt and am unshapen thus? <|nl|> My dukedom to a beggarly denier, <|nl|> I do mistake my person all this while: <|nl|> Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot, <|nl|> Myself to be a marvellous proper man. <|nl|> I'll be at charges for a looking-glass, <|nl|> And entertain some score or two of tailors, <|nl|> To study fashions to adorn my body: <|nl|> Since I am crept in favour with myself, <|nl|> Will maintain it with some little cost. <|nl|> But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave; <|nl|> And then return lamenting to my love. <|nl|> Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass, <|nl|> That I may see my shadow as I pass. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty <|nl|> Will soon recover his accustom'd health. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREY: <|nl|> In that you brook it in, it makes him worse: <|nl|> Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort, <|nl|> And cheer his grace with quick and merry words. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> If he were dead, what would betide of me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> No other harm but loss of such a lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> The loss of such a lord includes all harm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREY: <|nl|> The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son, <|nl|> To be your comforter when he is gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Oh, he is young and his minority <|nl|> Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, <|nl|> A man that loves not me, nor none of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Is it concluded that he shall be protector? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> It is determined, not concluded yet: <|nl|> But so it must be, if the king miscarry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREY: <|nl|> Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Good time of day unto your royal grace! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> God make your majesty joyful as you have been! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby. <|nl|> To your good prayers will scarcely say amen. <|nl|> Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife, <|nl|> And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured <|nl|> I hate not you for her proud arrogance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> I do beseech you, either not believe <|nl|> The envious slanders of her false accusers; <|nl|> Or, if she be accused in true report, <|nl|> Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds <|nl|> From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> But now the Duke of Buckingham and I <|nl|> Are come from visiting his majesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> What likelihood of his amendment, lords? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> God grant him health! Did you confer with him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement <|nl|> Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers, <|nl|> And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain; <|nl|> And sent to warn them to his royal presence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Would all were well! but that will never be <|nl|> I fear our happiness is at the highest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> They do me wrong, and I will not endure it: <|nl|> Who are they that complain unto the king, <|nl|> That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not? <|nl|> By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly <|nl|> That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours. <|nl|> Because I cannot flatter and speak fair, <|nl|> Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog, <|nl|> Duck with French nods and apish courtesy, <|nl|> I must be held a rancorous enemy. <|nl|> Cannot a plain man live and think no harm, <|nl|> But thus his simple truth must be abused <|nl|> By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> To whom in all this presence speaks your grace? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace. <|nl|> When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong? <|nl|> Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction? <|nl|> A plague upon you all! His royal person,-- <|nl|> Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-- <|nl|> Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while, <|nl|> But you must trouble him with lewd complaints. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter. <|nl|> The king, of his own royal disposition, <|nl|> And not provoked by any suitor else; <|nl|> Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred, <|nl|> Which in your outward actions shows itself <|nl|> Against my kindred, brothers, and myself, <|nl|> Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather <|nl|> The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad, <|nl|> That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch: <|nl|> Since every Jack became a gentleman <|nl|> There's many a gentle person made a Jack. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Come, come, we know your meaning, brother <|nl|> Gloucester; <|nl|> You envy my advancement and my friends': <|nl|> God grant we never may have need of you! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Meantime, God grants that we have need of you: <|nl|> Your brother is imprison'd by your means, <|nl|> Myself disgraced, and the nobility <|nl|> Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions <|nl|> Are daily given to ennoble those <|nl|> That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> By Him that raised me to this careful height <|nl|> From that contented hap which I enjoy'd, <|nl|> I never did incense his majesty <|nl|> Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been <|nl|> An earnest advocate to plead for him. <|nl|> My lord, you do me shameful injury, <|nl|> Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> You may deny that you were not the cause <|nl|> Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> She may, my lord, for-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so? <|nl|> She may do more, sir, than denying that: <|nl|> She may help you to many fair preferments, <|nl|> And then deny her aiding hand therein, <|nl|> And lay those honours on your high deserts. <|nl|> What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> What, marry, may she? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> What, marry, may she! marry with a king, <|nl|> A bachelor, a handsome stripling too: <|nl|> I wis your grandam had a worser match. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne <|nl|> Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs: <|nl|> By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty <|nl|> With those gross taunts I often have endured. <|nl|> I had rather be a country servant-maid <|nl|> Than a great queen, with this condition, <|nl|> To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at: <|nl|> Small joy have I in being England's queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee! <|nl|> Thy honour, state and seat is due to me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> What! threat you me with telling of the king? <|nl|> Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said <|nl|> I will avouch in presence of the king: <|nl|> I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower. <|nl|> 'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Out, devil! I remember them too well: <|nl|> Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower, <|nl|> And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king, <|nl|> I was a pack-horse in his great affairs; <|nl|> A weeder-out of his proud adversaries, <|nl|> A liberal rewarder of his friends: <|nl|> To royalize his blood I spilt mine own. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Yea, and much better blood than his or thine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> In all which time you and your husband Grey <|nl|> Were factious for the house of Lancaster; <|nl|> And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband <|nl|> In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain? <|nl|> Let me put in your minds, if you forget, <|nl|> What you have been ere now, and what you are; <|nl|> Withal, what I have been, and what I am. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> A murderous villain, and so still thou art. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick; <|nl|> Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Which God revenge! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> To fight on Edward's party for the crown; <|nl|> And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up. <|nl|> I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's; <|nl|> Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine <|nl|> I am too childish-foolish for this world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world, <|nl|> Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days <|nl|> Which here you urge to prove us enemies, <|nl|> We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king: <|nl|> So should we you, if you should be our king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar: <|nl|> Far be it from my heart, the thought of it! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> As little joy, my lord, as you suppose <|nl|> You should enjoy, were you this country's king, <|nl|> As little joy may you suppose in me. <|nl|> That I enjoy, being the queen thereof. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> A little joy enjoys the queen thereof; <|nl|> For I am she, and altogether joyless. <|nl|> I can no longer hold me patient. <|nl|> Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out <|nl|> In sharing that which you have pill'd from me! <|nl|> Which of you trembles not that looks on me? <|nl|> If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects, <|nl|> Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels? <|nl|> O gentle villain, do not turn away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> But repetition of what thou hast marr'd; <|nl|> That will I make before I let thee go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Wert thou not banished on pain of death? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> I was; but I do find more pain in banishment <|nl|> Than death can yield me here by my abode. <|nl|> A husband and a son thou owest to me; <|nl|> And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance: <|nl|> The sorrow that I have, by right is yours, <|nl|> And all the pleasures you usurp are mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> The curse my noble father laid on thee, <|nl|> When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper <|nl|> And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes, <|nl|> And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout <|nl|> Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland-- <|nl|> His curses, then from bitterness of soul <|nl|> Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee; <|nl|> And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> So just is God, to right the innocent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe, <|nl|> And the most merciless that e'er was heard of! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> No man but prophesied revenge for it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Northumberland, then present, wept to see it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> What were you snarling all before I came, <|nl|> Ready to catch each other by the throat, <|nl|> And turn you all your hatred now on me? <|nl|> Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven? <|nl|> That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death, <|nl|> Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment, <|nl|> Could all but answer for that peevish brat? <|nl|> Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven? <|nl|> Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses! <|nl|> If not by war, by surfeit die your king, <|nl|> As ours by murder, to make him a king! <|nl|> Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales, <|nl|> For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales, <|nl|> Die in his youth by like untimely violence! <|nl|> Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen, <|nl|> Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self! <|nl|> Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss; <|nl|> And see another, as I see thee now, <|nl|> Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine! <|nl|> Long die thy happy days before thy death; <|nl|> And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief, <|nl|> Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen! <|nl|> Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by, <|nl|> And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son <|nl|> Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him, <|nl|> That none of you may live your natural age, <|nl|> But by some unlook'd accident cut off! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> And leave out thee?

<|nl|> Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself. <|nl|> The time will come when thou shalt wish for me <|nl|> To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse, <|nl|> Lest to thy harm thou move our patience. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Were you well served, you would be taught your duty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> To serve me well, you all should do me duty, <|nl|> Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects: <|nl|> O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> Dispute not with her; she is lunatic. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Peace, master marquess, you are malapert: <|nl|> Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current. <|nl|> O, that your young nobility could judge <|nl|> What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable! <|nl|> They that stand high have many blasts to shake them; <|nl|> And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Yea, and much more: but I was born so high, <|nl|> Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top, <|nl|> And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas! <|nl|> Witness my son, now in the shade of death; <|nl|> Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath <|nl|> Hath in eternal darkness folded up. <|nl|> Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest. <|nl|> O God, that seest it, do not suffer it! <|nl|> As it was won with blood, lost be it so! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Have done! for shame, if not for charity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Urge neither charity nor shame to me: <|nl|> Uncharitably with me have you dealt, <|nl|> And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd. <|nl|> My charity is outrage, life my shame <|nl|> And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Have done, have done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand, <|nl|> In sign of league and amity with thee: <|nl|> Now fair befal thee and thy noble house! <|nl|> Thy garments are not spotted with our blood, <|nl|> Nor thou within the compass of my curse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Nor no one here; for curses never pass <|nl|> The lips of those that breathe them in the air. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> I'll not believe but they ascend the sky, <|nl|> And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace. <|nl|> O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog! <|nl|> Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites, <|nl|> His venom tooth will rankle to the death: <|nl|> Have not to do with him, beware of him; <|nl|> Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him, <|nl|> And all their ministers attend on him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel? <|nl|> And soothe the devil that I warn thee from? <|nl|> O, but remember this another day, <|nl|> When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow, <|nl|> And say poor Margaret was a prophetess! <|nl|> Live each of you the subjects to his hate, <|nl|> And he to yours, and all of you to God's! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother, <|nl|> She hath had too much wrong; and I repent <|nl|> My part thereof that I have done to her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> I never did her any, to my knowledge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> But you have all the vantage of her wrong. <|nl|> I was too hot to do somebody good, <|nl|> That is too cold in thinking of it now. <|nl|> Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid, <|nl|> He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains <|nl|> God pardon them that are the cause of it! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion, <|nl|> To pray for them that have done scathe to us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> So do I ever: <|nl|> being well-advised. <|nl|> For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> Madam, his majesty doth call for you, <|nl|> And for your grace; and you, my noble lords. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Madam, we will attend your grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl. <|nl|> The secret mischiefs that I set abroach <|nl|> I lay unto the grievous charge of others. <|nl|> Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness, <|nl|> I do beweep to many simple gulls <|nl|> Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham; <|nl|> And say it is the queen and her allies <|nl|> That stir the king against the duke my brother. <|nl|> Now, they believe it; and withal whet me <|nl|> To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: <|nl|> But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture, <|nl|> Tell them that God bids us do good for evil: <|nl|> And thus I clothe my naked villany <|nl|> With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ; <|nl|> And seem a saint, when most I play the devil. <|nl|> But, soft! here come my executioners. <|nl|> How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates! <|nl|> Are you now going to dispatch this deed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant <|nl|> That we may be admitted where he is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Well thought upon; I have it here about me. <|nl|> When you have done, repair to Crosby Place. <|nl|> But, sirs, be sudden in the execution, <|nl|> Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead; <|nl|> For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps <|nl|> May move your hearts to pity if you mark him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Tush! <|nl|> Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate; <|nl|> Talkers are no good doers: be assured <|nl|> We come to use our hands and not our tongues. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears: <|nl|> I like you, lads; about your business straight; <|nl|> Go, go, dispatch. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> We will, my noble lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> Why looks your grace so heavily today? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> O, I have pass'd a miserable night, <|nl|> So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams, <|nl|> That, as I am a Christian faithful man, <|nl|> I would not spend another such a night, <|nl|> Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days, <|nl|> So full of dismal terror was the time! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower, <|nl|> And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy; <|nl|> And, in my company, my brother Gloucester; <|nl|> Who from my cabin tempted me to walk <|nl|> Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England, <|nl|> And cited up a thousand fearful times, <|nl|> During the wars of York and Lancaster <|nl|> That had befall'n us. As we paced along <|nl|> Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, <|nl|> Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling, <|nl|> Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard, <|nl|> Into the tumbling billows of the main. <|nl|> Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown! <|nl|> What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears! <|nl|> What ugly sights of death within mine eyes! <|nl|> Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks; <|nl|> Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon; <|nl|> Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, <|nl|> Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, <|nl|> All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea: <|nl|> Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes <|nl|> Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept, <|nl|> As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems, <|nl|> Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep, <|nl|> And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> Had you such leisure in the time of death <|nl|> To gaze upon the secrets of the deep? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Methought I had; and often did I strive <|nl|> To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood <|nl|> Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth <|nl|> To seek the empty, vast and wandering air; <|nl|> But smother'd it within my panting bulk, <|nl|> Which almost burst to belch it in the sea. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> Awaked you not with this sore agony? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life; <|nl|> O, then began the tempest to my soul, <|nl|> Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood, <|nl|> With that grim ferryman which poets write of, <|nl|> Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. <|nl|> The first that there did greet my stranger soul, <|nl|> Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick; <|nl|> Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury <|nl|> Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?' <|nl|> And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by <|nl|> A shadow like an angel, with bright hair <|nl|> Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud, <|nl|> 'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence, <|nl|> That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury; <|nl|> Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!' <|nl|> With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends <|nl|> Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears <|nl|> Such hideous cries, that with the very noise <|nl|> I trembling waked, and for a season after <|nl|> Could not believe but that I was in hell, <|nl|> Such terrible impression made the dream. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you; <|nl|> I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> O Brakenbury, I have done those things, <|nl|> Which now bear evidence against my soul, <|nl|> For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me! <|nl|> O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee, <|nl|> But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds, <|nl|> Yet execute thy wrath in me alone, <|nl|> O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children! <|nl|> I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me; <|nl|> My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest! <|nl|> Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours, <|nl|> Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night. <|nl|> Princes have but their tides for their glories, <|nl|> An outward honour for an inward toil; <|nl|> And, for unfelt imagination, <|nl|> They often feel a world of restless cares: <|nl|> So that, betwixt their tides and low names, <|nl|> There's nothing differs but the outward fame. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Ho! who's here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> In God's name what are you, and how came you hither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> Yea, are you so brief? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show <|nl|> him our commission; talk no more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> I am, in this, commanded to deliver <|nl|> The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands: <|nl|> I will not reason what is meant hereby, <|nl|> Because I will be guiltless of the meaning. <|nl|> Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep: <|nl|> I'll to the king; and signify to him <|nl|> That thus I have resign'd my charge to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> What, shall we stab him as he sleeps? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till <|nl|> the judgment-day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind <|nl|> of remorse in me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> What, art thou afraid? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be <|nl|> damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> I thought thou hadst been resolute. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> So I am, to let him live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour <|nl|> will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one <|nl|> would tell twenty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> How dost thou feel thyself now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> 'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet <|nl|> within me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Remember our reward, when the deed is done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> 'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Where is thy conscience now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> In the Duke of Gloucester's purse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> So when he opens his purse to give us our reward, <|nl|> thy conscience flies out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> How if it come to thee again? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it <|nl|> makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it <|nl|> accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him; <|nl|> he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it <|nl|> detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that <|nl|> mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of <|nl|> obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold <|nl|> that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it <|nl|> is turned out of all towns and cities for a <|nl|> dangerous thing; and every man that means to live <|nl|> well endeavours to trust to himself and to live <|nl|> without it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> 'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me <|nl|> not to kill the duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he <|nl|> would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me, <|nl|> I warrant thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his <|nl|> reputation. Come, shall we to this gear? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy <|nl|> sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt <|nl|> in the next room. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> O excellent devise! make a sop of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Hark! he stirs: shall I strike? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> No, first let's reason with him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second murderer: <|nl|> You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> In God's name, what art thou? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> A man, as you are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> But not, as I am, royal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> Nor you, as we are, loyal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak! <|nl|> Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale? <|nl|> Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both: <|nl|> To, to, to-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> To murder me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both: <|nl|> Ay, ay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, <|nl|> And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it. <|nl|> Wherein, my friends, have I offended you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Offended us you have not, but the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> I shall be reconciled to him again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Are you call'd forth from out a world of men <|nl|> To slay the innocent? What is my offence? <|nl|> Where are the evidence that do accuse me? <|nl|> What lawful quest have given their verdict up <|nl|> Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced <|nl|> The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death? <|nl|> Before I be convict by course of law, <|nl|> To threaten me with death is most unlawful. <|nl|> I charge you, as you hope to have redemption <|nl|> By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins, <|nl|> That you depart and lay no hands on me <|nl|> The deed you undertake is damnable. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> What we will do, we do upon command. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> And he that hath commanded is the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings <|nl|> Hath in the tables of his law commanded <|nl|> That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then, <|nl|> Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's? <|nl|> Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands, <|nl|> To hurl upon their heads that break his law. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee, <|nl|> For false forswearing and for murder too: <|nl|> Thou didst receive the holy sacrament, <|nl|> To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> And, like a traitor to the name of God, <|nl|> Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade <|nl|> Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us, <|nl|> When thou hast broke it in so dear degree? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed? <|nl|> For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs, <|nl|> He sends ye not to murder me for this <|nl|> For in this sin he is as deep as I. <|nl|> If God will be revenged for this deed. <|nl|> O, know you yet, he doth it publicly, <|nl|> Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm; <|nl|> He needs no indirect nor lawless course <|nl|> To cut off those that have offended him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Who made thee, then, a bloody minister, <|nl|> When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet, <|nl|> That princely novice, was struck dead by thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> My brother's love, the devil, and my rage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault, <|nl|> Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me; <|nl|> I am his brother, and I love him well. <|nl|> If you be hired for meed, go back again, <|nl|> And I will send you to my brother Gloucester, <|nl|> Who shall reward you better for my life <|nl|> Than Edward will for tidings of my death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear: <|nl|> Go you to him from me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Both: <|nl|> Ay, so we will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Tell him, when that our princely father York <|nl|> Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm, <|nl|> And charged us from his soul to love each other, <|nl|> He little thought of this divided friendship: <|nl|> Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> O, do not slander him, for he is kind. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Right, <|nl|> As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself: <|nl|> 'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> It cannot be; for when I parted with him, <|nl|> He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs, <|nl|> That he would labour my delivery. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee <|nl|> From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul, <|nl|> To counsel me to make my peace with God, <|nl|> And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind, <|nl|> That thou wilt war with God by murdering me? <|nl|> Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on <|nl|> To do this deed will hate you for the deed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> What shall we do? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Relent, and save your souls. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish. <|nl|> Which of you, if you were a prince's son, <|nl|> Being pent from liberty, as I am now, <|nl|> if two such murderers as yourselves came to you, <|nl|> Would not entreat for life? <|nl|> My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks: <|nl|> O, if thine eye be not a flatterer, <|nl|> Come thou on my side, and entreat for me, <|nl|> As you would beg, were you in my distress <|nl|> A begging prince what beggar pities not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> Look behind you, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> Take that, and that: if all this will not do, <|nl|> I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd! <|nl|> How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands <|nl|> Of this most grievous guilty murder done! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not? <|nl|> By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Murderer: <|nl|> I would he knew that I had saved his brother! <|nl|> Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say; <|nl|> For I repent me that the duke is slain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Murderer: <|nl|> So do not I: go, coward as thou art. <|nl|> Now must I hide his body in some hole, <|nl|> Until the duke take order for his burial: <|nl|> And when I have my meed, I must away; <|nl|> For this will out, and here I must not stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Why, so: now have I done a good day's work: <|nl|> You peers, continue this united league: <|nl|> I every day expect an embassage <|nl|> From my Redeemer to redeem me hence; <|nl|> And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven, <|nl|> Since I have set my friends at peace on earth. <|nl|> Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand; <|nl|> Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate: <|nl|> And with my hand I seal my true heart's love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> So thrive I, as I truly swear the like! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Take heed you dally not before your king; <|nl|> Lest he that is the supreme King of kings <|nl|> Confound your hidden falsehood, and award <|nl|> Either of you to be the other's end. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> So prosper I, as I swear perfect love! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> And I, as I love Hastings with my heart! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Madam, yourself are not exempt in this, <|nl|> Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you; <|nl|> You have been factious one against the other, <|nl|> Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand; <|nl|> And what you do, do it unfeignedly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Here, Hastings; I will never more remember <|nl|> Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> This interchange of love, I here protest, <|nl|> Upon my part shall be unviolable. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> And so swear I, my lord <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league <|nl|> With thy embracements to my wife's allies, <|nl|> And make me happy in your unity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate <|nl|> On you or yours, <|nl|> but with all duteous love <|nl|> Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me <|nl|> With hate in those where I expect most love! <|nl|> When I have most need to employ a friend, <|nl|> And most assured that he is a friend <|nl|> Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile, <|nl|> Be he unto me! this do I beg of God, <|nl|> When I am cold in zeal to yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham, <|nl|> is this thy vow unto my sickly heart. <|nl|> There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here, <|nl|> To make the perfect period of this peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> And, in good time, here comes the noble duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen: <|nl|> And, princely peers, a happy time of day! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day. <|nl|> Brother, we done deeds of charity; <|nl|> Made peace enmity, fair love of hate, <|nl|> Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege: <|nl|> Amongst this princely heap, if any here, <|nl|> By false intelligence, or wrong surmise, <|nl|> Hold me a foe; <|nl|> If I unwittingly, or in my rage, <|nl|> Have aught committed that is hardly borne <|nl|> By any in this presence, I desire <|nl|> To reconcile me to his friendly peace: <|nl|> 'Tis death to me to be at enmity; <|nl|> I hate it, and desire all good men's love. <|nl|> First, madam, I entreat true peace of you, <|nl|> Which I will purchase with my duteous service; <|nl|> Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham, <|nl|> If ever any grudge were lodged between us; <|nl|> Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you; <|nl|> That without desert have frown'd on me; <|nl|> Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all. <|nl|> I do not know that Englishman alive <|nl|> With whom my soul is any jot at odds <|nl|> More than the infant that is born to-night <|nl|> I thank my God for my humility. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> A holy day shall this be kept hereafter: <|nl|> I would to God all strifes were well compounded. <|nl|> My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty <|nl|> To take our brother Clarence to your grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this <|nl|> To be so bouted in this royal presence? <|nl|> Who knows not that the noble duke is dead? <|nl|> You do him injury to scorn his corse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> All seeing heaven, what a world is this! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence <|nl|> But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> But he, poor soul, by your first order died, <|nl|> And that a winged Mercury did bear: <|nl|> Some tardy cripple bore the countermand, <|nl|> That came too lag to see him buried. <|nl|> God grant that some, less noble and less loyal, <|nl|> Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood, <|nl|> Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did, <|nl|> And yet go current from suspicion! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> A boon, my sovereign, for my service done! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> I will not rise, unless your highness grant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life; <|nl|> Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman <|nl|> Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Have a tongue to doom my brother's death, <|nl|> And shall the same give pardon to a slave? <|nl|> My brother slew no man; his fault was thought, <|nl|> And yet his punishment was cruel death. <|nl|> Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage, <|nl|> Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised <|nl|> Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love? <|nl|> Who told me how the poor soul did forsake <|nl|> The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me? <|nl|> Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury <|nl|> When Oxford had me down, he rescued me, <|nl|> And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'? <|nl|> Who told me, when we both lay in the field <|nl|> Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me <|nl|> Even in his own garments, and gave himself, <|nl|> All thin and naked, to the numb cold night? <|nl|> All this from my remembrance brutish wrath <|nl|> Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you <|nl|> Had so much grace to put it in my mind. <|nl|> But when your carters or your waiting-vassals <|nl|> Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced <|nl|> The precious image of our dear Redeemer, <|nl|> You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon; <|nl|> And I unjustly too, must grant it you <|nl|> But for my brother not a man would speak, <|nl|> Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself <|nl|> For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all <|nl|> Have been beholding to him in his life; <|nl|> Yet none of you would once plead for his life. <|nl|> O God, I fear thy justice will take hold <|nl|> On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this! <|nl|> Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. <|nl|> Oh, poor Clarence! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not <|nl|> How that the guilty kindred of the queen <|nl|> Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death? <|nl|> O, they did urge it still unto the king! <|nl|> God will revenge it. But come, let us in, <|nl|> To comfort Edward with our company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> We wait upon your grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boy: <|nl|> Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> No, boy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boy: <|nl|> Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast, <|nl|> And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!' <|nl|>  <|nl|> Girl: <|nl|> Why do you look on us, and shake your head, <|nl|> And call us wretches, orphans, castaways <|nl|> If that our noble father be alive? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> My pretty cousins, you mistake me much; <|nl|> I do lament the sickness of the king. <|nl|> As loath to lose him, not your father's death; <|nl|> It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boy: <|nl|> Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead. <|nl|> The king my uncle is to blame for this: <|nl|> God will revenge it; whom I will importune <|nl|> With daily prayers all to that effect. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Girl: <|nl|> And so will I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well: <|nl|> Incapable and shallow innocents, <|nl|> You cannot guess who caused your father's death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boy: <|nl|> Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester <|nl|> Told me, the king, provoked by the queen, <|nl|> Devised impeachments to imprison him : <|nl|> And when my uncle told me so, he wept, <|nl|> And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek; <|nl|> Bade me rely on him as on my father, <|nl|> And he would love me dearly as his child. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes, <|nl|> And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile! <|nl|> He is my son; yea, and therein my shame; <|nl|> Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boy: <|nl|> Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Ay, boy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boy: <|nl|> I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep, <|nl|> To chide my fortune, and torment myself? <|nl|> I'll join with black despair against my soul, <|nl|> And to myself become an enemy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> What means this scene of rude impatience? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> To make an act of tragic violence: <|nl|> Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead. <|nl|> Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd? <|nl|> Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone? <|nl|> If you will live, lament; if die, be brief, <|nl|> That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's; <|nl|> Or, like obedient subjects, follow him <|nl|> To his new kingdom of perpetual rest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow <|nl|> As I had title in thy noble husband! <|nl|> I have bewept a worthy husband's death, <|nl|> And lived by looking on his images: <|nl|> But now two mirrors of his princely semblance <|nl|> Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death, <|nl|> And I for comfort have but one false glass, <|nl|> Which grieves me when I see my shame in him. <|nl|> Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother, <|nl|> And hast the comfort of thy children left thee: <|nl|> But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms, <|nl|> And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs, <|nl|> Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I, <|nl|> Thine being but a moiety of my grief, <|nl|> To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boy: <|nl|> Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death; <|nl|> How can we aid you with our kindred tears? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Girl: <|nl|> Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd; <|nl|> Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Give me no help in lamentation; <|nl|> I am not barren to bring forth complaints <|nl|> All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, <|nl|> That I, being govern'd by the watery moon, <|nl|> May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! <|nl|> Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Children: <|nl|> Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Children: <|nl|> What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> What stays had I but they? and they are gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Was never widow had so dear a loss! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Children: <|nl|> Were never orphans had so dear a loss! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Was never mother had so dear a loss! <|nl|> Alas, I am the mother of these moans! <|nl|> Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general. <|nl|> She for an Edward weeps, and so do I; <|nl|> I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she: <|nl|> These babes for Clarence weep and so do I; <|nl|> I for an Edward weep, so do not they: <|nl|> Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd, <|nl|> Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse, <|nl|> And I will pamper it with lamentations. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased <|nl|> That you take with unthankfulness, his doing: <|nl|> In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful, <|nl|> With dull unwilligness to repay a debt <|nl|> Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent; <|nl|> Much more to be thus opposite with heaven, <|nl|> For it requires the royal debt it lent you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother, <|nl|> Of the young prince your son: send straight for him <|nl|> Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives: <|nl|> Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave, <|nl|> And plant your joys in living Edward's throne. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause <|nl|> To wail the dimming of our shining star; <|nl|> But none can cure their harms by wailing them. <|nl|> Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy; <|nl|> I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee <|nl|> I crave your blessing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind, <|nl|> Love, charity, obedience, and true duty! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers, <|nl|> That bear this mutual heavy load of moan, <|nl|> Now cheer each other in each other's love <|nl|> Though we have spent our harvest of this king, <|nl|> We are to reap the harvest of his son. <|nl|> The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts, <|nl|> But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together, <|nl|> Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept: <|nl|> Me seemeth good, that, with some little train, <|nl|> Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd <|nl|> Hither to London, to be crown'd our king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude, <|nl|> The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out, <|nl|> Which would be so much the more dangerous <|nl|> By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd: <|nl|> Where every horse bears his commanding rein, <|nl|> And may direct his course as please himself, <|nl|> As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent, <|nl|> In my opinion, ought to be prevented. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I hope the king made peace with all of us <|nl|> And the compact is firm and true in me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> And so in me; and so, I think, in all: <|nl|> Yet, since it is but green, it should be put <|nl|> To no apparent likelihood of breach, <|nl|> Which haply by much company might be urged: <|nl|> Therefore I say with noble Buckingham, <|nl|> That it is meet so few should fetch the prince. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> And so say I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Then be it so; and go we to determine <|nl|> Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow. <|nl|> Madam, and you, my mother, will you go <|nl|> To give your censures in this weighty business? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> With all our harts. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince, <|nl|> For God's sake, let not us two be behind; <|nl|> For, by the way, I'll sort occasion, <|nl|> As index to the story we late talk'd of, <|nl|> To part the queen's proud kindred from the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> My other self, my counsel's consistory, <|nl|> My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin, <|nl|> I, like a child, will go by thy direction. <|nl|> Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> I promise you, I scarcely know myself: <|nl|> Hear you the news abroad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Ay, that the king is dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better: <|nl|> I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Neighbours, God speed! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Give you good morrow, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Then, masters, look to see a troublous world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> In him there is a hope of government, <|nl|> That in his nonage council under him, <|nl|> And in his full and ripen'd years himself, <|nl|> No doubt, shall then and till then govern well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> So stood the state when Henry the Sixth <|nl|> Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot; <|nl|> For then this land was famously enrich'd <|nl|> With politic grave counsel; then the king <|nl|> Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Better it were they all came by the father, <|nl|> Or by the father there were none at all; <|nl|> For emulation now, who shall be nearest, <|nl|> Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not. <|nl|> O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester! <|nl|> And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud: <|nl|> And were they to be ruled, and not to rule, <|nl|> This sickly land might solace as before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks; <|nl|> When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand; <|nl|> When the sun sets, who doth not look for night? <|nl|> Untimely storms make men expect a dearth. <|nl|> All may be well; but, if God sort it so, <|nl|> 'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Truly, the souls of men are full of dread: <|nl|> Ye cannot reason almost with a man <|nl|> That looks not heavily and full of fear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> Before the times of change, still is it so: <|nl|> By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust <|nl|> Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see <|nl|> The waters swell before a boisterous storm. <|nl|> But leave it all to God. whither away? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Citizen: <|nl|> Marry, we were sent for to the justices. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Citizen: <|nl|> And so was I: I'll bear you company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <|nl|> Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton; <|nl|> At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night: <|nl|> To-morrow, or next day, they will be here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I long with all my heart to see the prince: <|nl|> I hope he is much grown since last I saw him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> But I hear, no; they say my son of York <|nl|> Hath almost overta'en him in his growth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Ay, mother; but I would not have it so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper, <|nl|> My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow <|nl|> More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle <|nl|> Gloucester, <|nl|> 'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:' <|nl|> And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast, <|nl|> Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold <|nl|> In him that did object the same to thee; <|nl|> He was the wretched'st thing when he was young, <|nl|> So long a-growing and so leisurely, <|nl|> That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <|nl|> Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd, <|nl|> I could have given my uncle's grace a flout, <|nl|> To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast <|nl|> That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old <|nl|> 'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth. <|nl|> Grandam, this would have been a biting jest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Grandam, his nurse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <|nl|> Good madam, be not angry with the child. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Pitchers have ears. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <|nl|> Here comes a messenger. What news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> How fares the prince? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Well, madam, and in health. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> What is thy news then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret, <|nl|> With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Who hath committed them? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> The mighty dukes <|nl|> Gloucester and Buckingham. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> For what offence? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> The sum of all I can, I have disclosed; <|nl|> Why or for what these nobles were committed <|nl|> Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Ay me, I see the downfall of our house! <|nl|> The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind; <|nl|> Insulting tyranny begins to jet <|nl|> Upon the innocent and aweless throne: <|nl|> Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre! <|nl|> I see, as in a map, the end of all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Accursed and unquiet wrangling days, <|nl|> How many of you have mine eyes beheld! <|nl|> My husband lost his life to get the crown; <|nl|> And often up and down my sons were toss'd, <|nl|> For me to joy and weep their gain and loss: <|nl|> And being seated, and domestic broils <|nl|> Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors. <|nl|> Make war upon themselves; blood against blood, <|nl|> Self against self: O, preposterous <|nl|> And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen; <|nl|> Or let me die, to look on death no more! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary. <|nl|> Madam, farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I'll go along with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> You have no cause. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHBISHOP OF YORK: <|nl|> My gracious lady, go; <|nl|> And thither bear your treasure and your goods. <|nl|> For my part, I'll resign unto your grace <|nl|> The seal I keep: and so betide to me <|nl|> As well I tender you and all of yours! <|nl|> Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign <|nl|> The weary way hath made you melancholy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> No, uncle; but our crosses on the way <|nl|> Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy <|nl|> I want more uncles here to welcome me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years <|nl|> Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit <|nl|> Nor more can you distinguish of a man <|nl|> Than of his outward show; which, God he knows, <|nl|> Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart. <|nl|> Those uncles which you want were dangerous; <|nl|> Your grace attended to their sugar'd words, <|nl|> But look'd not on the poison of their hearts : <|nl|> God keep you from them, and from such false friends! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> God keep me from false friends! but they were none. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Mayor: <|nl|> God bless your grace with health and happy days! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all. <|nl|> I thought my mother, and my brother York, <|nl|> Would long ere this have met us on the way <|nl|> Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not <|nl|> To tell us whether they will come or no! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> On what occasion, God he knows, not I, <|nl|> The queen your mother, and your brother York, <|nl|> Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince <|nl|> Would fain have come with me to meet your grace, <|nl|> But by his mother was perforce withheld. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Fie, what an indirect and peevish course <|nl|> Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace <|nl|> Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York <|nl|> Unto his princely brother presently? <|nl|> If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him, <|nl|> And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CARDINAL: <|nl|> My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory <|nl|> Can from his mother win the Duke of York, <|nl|> Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate <|nl|> To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid <|nl|> We should infringe the holy privilege <|nl|> Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land <|nl|> Would I be guilty of so deep a sin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord, <|nl|> Too ceremonious and traditional <|nl|> Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, <|nl|> You break not sanctuary in seizing him. <|nl|> The benefit thereof is always granted <|nl|> To those whose dealings have deserved the place, <|nl|> And those who have the wit to claim the place: <|nl|> This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it; <|nl|> And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it: <|nl|> Then, taking him from thence that is not there, <|nl|> You break no privilege nor charter there. <|nl|> Oft have I heard of sanctuary men; <|nl|> But sanctuary children ne'er till now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CARDINAL: <|nl|> My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once. <|nl|> Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> I go, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may. <|nl|> Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come, <|nl|> Where shall we sojourn till our coronation? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Where it seems best unto your royal self. <|nl|> If I may counsel you, some day or two <|nl|> Your highness shall repose you at the Tower: <|nl|> Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit <|nl|> For your best health and recreation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> I do not like the Tower, of any place. <|nl|> Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> He did, my gracious lord, begin that place; <|nl|> Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Is it upon record, or else reported <|nl|> Successively from age to age, he built it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Upon record, my gracious lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> But say, my lord, it were not register'd, <|nl|> Methinks the truth should live from age to age, <|nl|> As 'twere retail'd to all posterity, <|nl|> Even to the general all-ending day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> What say you, uncle? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I say, without characters, fame lives long. <|nl|> Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity, <|nl|> I moralize two meanings in one word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> That Julius Caesar was a famous man; <|nl|> With what his valour did enrich his wit, <|nl|> His wit set down to make his valour live <|nl|> Death makes no conquest of this conqueror; <|nl|> For now he lives in fame, though not in life. <|nl|> I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> What, my gracious lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> An if I live until I be a man, <|nl|> I'll win our ancient right in France again, <|nl|> Or die a soldier, as I lived a king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Richard of York! how fares our loving brother? <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours: <|nl|> Too late he died that might have kept that title, <|nl|> Which by his death hath lost much majesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York? <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord, <|nl|> You said that idle weeds are fast in growth <|nl|> The prince my brother hath outgrown me far. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> He hath, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> And therefore is he idle? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> O, my fair cousin, I must not say so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Then is he more beholding to you than I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> He may command me as my sovereign; <|nl|> But you have power in me as in a kinsman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> A beggar, brother? <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Of my kind uncle, that I know will give; <|nl|> And being but a toy, which is no grief to give. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> A gentle cousin, were it light enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts; <|nl|> In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> It is too heavy for your grace to wear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> I weigh it lightly, were it heavier. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> What, would you have my weapon, little lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> I would, that I might thank you as you call me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> How? <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Little. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> My Lord of York will still be cross in talk: <|nl|> Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me: <|nl|> Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me; <|nl|> Because that I am little, like an ape, <|nl|> He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons! <|nl|> To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle, <|nl|> He prettily and aptly taunts himself: <|nl|> So cunning and so young is wonderful. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> My lord, will't please you pass along? <|nl|> Myself and my good cousin Buckingham <|nl|> Will to your mother, to entreat of her <|nl|> To meet you at the Tower and welcome you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> My lord protector needs will have it so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Why, what should you fear? <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost: <|nl|> My grandam told me he was murdered there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> I fear no uncles dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Nor none that live, I hope. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> An if they live, I hope I need not fear. <|nl|> But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart, <|nl|> Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Think you, my lord, this little prating York <|nl|> Was not incensed by his subtle mother <|nl|> To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy; <|nl|> Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable <|nl|> He is all the mother's, from the top to toe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby. <|nl|> Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend <|nl|> As closely to conceal what we impart: <|nl|> Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way; <|nl|> What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter <|nl|> To make William Lord Hastings of our mind, <|nl|> For the instalment of this noble duke <|nl|> In the seat royal of this famous isle? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> He for his father's sake so loves the prince, <|nl|> That he will not be won to aught against him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> He will do all in all as Hastings doth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby, <|nl|> And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings, <|nl|> How doth he stand affected to our purpose; <|nl|> And summon him to-morrow to the Tower, <|nl|> To sit about the coronation. <|nl|> If thou dost find him tractable to us, <|nl|> Encourage him, and show him all our reasons: <|nl|> If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling, <|nl|> Be thou so too; and so break off your talk, <|nl|> And give us notice of his inclination: <|nl|> For we to-morrow hold divided councils, <|nl|> Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby, <|nl|> His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries <|nl|> To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle; <|nl|> And bid my friend, for joy of this good news, <|nl|> Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> My good lords both, with all the heed I may. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> You shall, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive <|nl|> Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do: <|nl|> And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me <|nl|> The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables <|nl|> Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> And look to have it yielded with all willingness. <|nl|> Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards <|nl|> We may digest our complots in some form. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> What, ho! my lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> A messenger from the Lord Stanley. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> What is't o'clock? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Upon the stroke of four. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> So it should seem by that I have to say. <|nl|> First, he commends him to your noble lordship. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> And then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> And then he sends you word <|nl|> He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm: <|nl|> Besides, he says there are two councils held; <|nl|> And that may be determined at the one <|nl|> which may make you and him to rue at the other. <|nl|> Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure, <|nl|> If presently you will take horse with him, <|nl|> And with all speed post with him toward the north, <|nl|> To shun the danger that his soul divines. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord; <|nl|> Bid him not fear the separated councils <|nl|> His honour and myself are at the one, <|nl|> And at the other is my servant Catesby <|nl|> Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us <|nl|> Whereof I shall not have intelligence. <|nl|> Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance: <|nl|> And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond <|nl|> To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers <|nl|> To fly the boar before the boar pursues, <|nl|> Were to incense the boar to follow us <|nl|> And make pursuit where he did mean no chase. <|nl|> Go, bid thy master rise and come to me <|nl|> And we will both together to the Tower, <|nl|> Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> Many good morrows to my noble lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring <|nl|> What news, what news, in this our tottering state? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord; <|nl|> And I believe twill never stand upright <|nl|> Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> Ay, my good lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders <|nl|> Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced. <|nl|> But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward <|nl|> Upon his party for the gain thereof: <|nl|> And thereupon he sends you this good news, <|nl|> That this same very day your enemies, <|nl|> The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Indeed, I am no mourner for that news, <|nl|> Because they have been still mine enemies: <|nl|> But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side, <|nl|> To bar my master's heirs in true descent, <|nl|> God knows I will not do it, to the death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> God keep your lordship in that gracious mind! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence, <|nl|> That they who brought me in my master's hate <|nl|> I live to look upon their tragedy. <|nl|> I tell thee, Catesby-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> What, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Ere a fortnight make me elder, <|nl|> I'll send some packing that yet think not on it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord, <|nl|> When men are unprepared and look not for it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out <|nl|> With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do <|nl|> With some men else, who think themselves as safe <|nl|> As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear <|nl|> To princely Richard and to Buckingham. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> The princes both make high account of you; <|nl|> For they account his head upon the bridge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> I know they do; and I have well deserved it. <|nl|> Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man? <|nl|> Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided? <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby: <|nl|> You may jest on, but, by the holy rood, <|nl|> I do not like these several councils, I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> My lord, <|nl|> I hold my life as dear as you do yours; <|nl|> And never in my life, I do protest, <|nl|> Was it more precious to me than 'tis now: <|nl|> Think you, but that I know our state secure, <|nl|> I would be so triumphant as I am? <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London, <|nl|> Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure, <|nl|> And they indeed had no cause to mistrust; <|nl|> But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast. <|nl|> This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt: <|nl|> Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward! <|nl|> What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord? <|nl|> To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD STANLEY: <|nl|> They, for their truth, might better wear their heads <|nl|> Than some that have accused them wear their hats. <|nl|> But come, my lord, let us away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow. <|nl|> How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pursuivant: <|nl|> The better that your lordship please to ask. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now <|nl|> Than when I met thee last where now we meet: <|nl|> Then was I going prisoner to the Tower, <|nl|> By the suggestion of the queen's allies; <|nl|> But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself-- <|nl|> This day those enemies are put to death, <|nl|> And I in better state than e'er I was. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pursuivant: <|nl|> God hold it, to your honour's good content! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pursuivant: <|nl|> God save your lordship! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Priest: <|nl|> Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart. <|nl|> I am in your debt for your last exercise; <|nl|> Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain? <|nl|> Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest; <|nl|> Your honour hath no shriving work in hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Good faith, and when I met this holy man, <|nl|> Those men you talk of came into my mind. <|nl|> What, go you toward the Tower? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay <|nl|> I shall return before your lordship thence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> 'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> I'll wait upon your lordship. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> Come, bring forth the prisoners. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this: <|nl|> To-day shalt thou behold a subject die <|nl|> For truth, for duty, and for loyalty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREY: <|nl|> God keep the prince from all the pack of you! <|nl|> A knot you are of damned blood-suckers! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VAUGHAN: <|nl|> You live that shall cry woe for this after. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison, <|nl|> Fatal and ominous to noble peers! <|nl|> Within the guilty closure of thy walls <|nl|> Richard the second here was hack'd to death; <|nl|> And, for more slander to thy dismal seat, <|nl|> We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREY: <|nl|> Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads, <|nl|> For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham, <|nl|> Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God <|nl|> To hear her prayers for them, as now for us <|nl|> And for my sister and her princely sons, <|nl|> Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood, <|nl|> Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> Make haste; the hour of death is expiate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace: <|nl|> And take our leave, until we meet in heaven. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> My lords, at once: the cause why we are met <|nl|> Is, to determine of the coronation. <|nl|> In God's name, speak: when is the royal day? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Are all things fitting for that royal time? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> It is, and wants but nomination. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF ELY: <|nl|> To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Who knows the lord protector's mind herein? <|nl|> Who is most inward with the royal duke? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF ELY: <|nl|> Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces, <|nl|> But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine, <|nl|> Than I of yours; <|nl|> Nor I no more of his, than you of mine. <|nl|> Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> I thank his grace, I know he loves me well; <|nl|> But, for his purpose in the coronation. <|nl|> I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd <|nl|> His gracious pleasure any way therein: <|nl|> But you, my noble lords, may name the time; <|nl|> And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice, <|nl|> Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF ELY: <|nl|> Now in good time, here comes the duke himself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow. <|nl|> I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope, <|nl|> My absence doth neglect no great designs, <|nl|> Which by my presence might have been concluded. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Had not you come upon your cue, my lord <|nl|> William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,-- <|nl|> I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder; <|nl|> His lordship knows me well, and loves me well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> I thank your grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> My lord of Ely! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF ELY: <|nl|> My lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> When I was last in Holborn, <|nl|> I saw good strawberries in your garden there <|nl|> I do beseech you send for some of them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF ELY: <|nl|> Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you. <|nl|> Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business, <|nl|> And finds the testy gentleman so hot, <|nl|> As he will lose his head ere give consent <|nl|> His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it, <|nl|> Shall lose the royalty of England's throne. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> We have not yet set down this day of triumph. <|nl|> To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden; <|nl|> For I myself am not so well provided <|nl|> As else I would be, were the day prolong'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF ELY: <|nl|> Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these <|nl|> strawberries. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day; <|nl|> There's some conceit or other likes him well, <|nl|> When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit. <|nl|> I think there's never a man in Christendom <|nl|> That can less hide his love or hate than he; <|nl|> For by his face straight shall you know his heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> What of his heart perceive you in his face <|nl|> By any likelihood he show'd to-day? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Marry, that with no man here he is offended; <|nl|> For, were he, he had shown it in his looks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> I pray God he be not, I say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I pray you all, tell me what they deserve <|nl|> That do conspire my death with devilish plots <|nl|> Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd <|nl|> Upon my body with their hellish charms? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> The tender love I bear your grace, my lord, <|nl|> Makes me most forward in this noble presence <|nl|> To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be <|nl|> I say, my lord, they have deserved death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Then be your eyes the witness of this ill: <|nl|> See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm <|nl|> Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up: <|nl|> And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch, <|nl|> Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore, <|nl|> That by their witchcraft thus have marked me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> If they have done this thing, my gracious lord-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> If I thou protector of this damned strumpet-- <|nl|> Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor: <|nl|> Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear, <|nl|> I will not dine until I see the same. <|nl|> Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done: <|nl|> The rest, that love me, rise and follow me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me; <|nl|> For I, too fond, might have prevented this. <|nl|> Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm; <|nl|> But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly: <|nl|> Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble, <|nl|> And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower, <|nl|> As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house. <|nl|> O, now I want the priest that spake to me: <|nl|> I now repent I told the pursuivant <|nl|> As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies, <|nl|> How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd, <|nl|> And I myself secure in grace and favour. <|nl|> O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse <|nl|> Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner: <|nl|> Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> O momentary grace of mortal men, <|nl|> Which we more hunt for than the grace of God! <|nl|> Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks, <|nl|> Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast, <|nl|> Ready, with every nod, to tumble down <|nl|> Into the fatal bowels of the deep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LOVEL: <|nl|> Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> O bloody Richard! miserable England! <|nl|> I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee <|nl|> That ever wretched age hath look'd upon. <|nl|> Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head. <|nl|> They smile at me that shortly shall be dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour, <|nl|> Murder thy breath in the middle of a word, <|nl|> And then begin again, and stop again, <|nl|> As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian; <|nl|> Speak and look back, and pry on every side, <|nl|> Tremble and start at wagging of a straw, <|nl|> Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks <|nl|> Are at my service, like enforced smiles; <|nl|> And both are ready in their offices, <|nl|> At any time, to grace my stratagems. <|nl|> But what, is Catesby gone? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Lord mayor,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Look to the drawbridge there! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Hark! a drum. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Catesby, o'erlook the walls. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Lord mayor, the reason we have sent-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Look back, defend thee, here are enemies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> God and our innocency defend and guard us! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LOVEL: <|nl|> Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, <|nl|> The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> So dear I loved the man, that I must weep. <|nl|> I took him for the plainest harmless creature <|nl|> That breathed upon this earth a Christian; <|nl|> Made him my book wherein my soul recorded <|nl|> The history of all her secret thoughts: <|nl|> So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue, <|nl|> That, his apparent open guilt omitted, <|nl|> I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife, <|nl|> He lived from all attainder of suspect. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor <|nl|> That ever lived. <|nl|> Would you imagine, or almost believe, <|nl|> Were't not that, by great preservation, <|nl|> We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor <|nl|> This day had plotted, in the council-house <|nl|> To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Mayor: <|nl|> What, had he so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> What, think You we are Turks or infidels? <|nl|> Or that we would, against the form of law, <|nl|> Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death, <|nl|> But that the extreme peril of the case, <|nl|> The peace of England and our persons' safety, <|nl|> Enforced us to this execution? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Mayor: <|nl|> Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death; <|nl|> And you my good lords, both have well proceeded, <|nl|> To warn false traitors from the like attempts. <|nl|> I never look'd for better at his hands, <|nl|> After he once fell in with Mistress Shore. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Yet had not we determined he should die, <|nl|> Until your lordship came to see his death; <|nl|> Which now the loving haste of these our friends, <|nl|> Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented: <|nl|> Because, my lord, we would have had you heard <|nl|> The traitor speak, and timorously confess <|nl|> The manner and the purpose of his treason; <|nl|> That you might well have signified the same <|nl|> Unto the citizens, who haply may <|nl|> Misconstrue us in him and wail his death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Mayor: <|nl|> But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve, <|nl|> As well as I had seen and heard him speak <|nl|> And doubt you not, right noble princes both, <|nl|> But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens <|nl|> With all your just proceedings in this cause. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here, <|nl|> To avoid the carping censures of the world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> But since you come too late of our intents, <|nl|> Yet witness what you hear we did intend: <|nl|> And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham. <|nl|> The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post: <|nl|> There, at your meet'st advantage of the time, <|nl|> Infer the bastardy of Edward's children: <|nl|> Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen, <|nl|> Only for saying he would make his son <|nl|> Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house, <|nl|> Which, by the sign thereof was termed so. <|nl|> Moreover, urge his hateful luxury <|nl|> And bestial appetite in change of lust; <|nl|> Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives, <|nl|> Even where his lustful eye or savage heart, <|nl|> Without control, listed to make his prey. <|nl|> Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: <|nl|> Tell them, when that my mother went with child <|nl|> Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York <|nl|> My princely father then had wars in France <|nl|> And, by just computation of the time, <|nl|> Found that the issue was not his begot; <|nl|> Which well appeared in his lineaments, <|nl|> Being nothing like the noble duke my father: <|nl|> But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off, <|nl|> Because you know, my lord, my mother lives. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator <|nl|> As if the golden fee for which I plead <|nl|> Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle; <|nl|> Where you shall find me well accompanied <|nl|> With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> I go: and towards three or four o'clock <|nl|> Look for the news that the Guildhall affords. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw; <|nl|> Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both <|nl|> Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle. <|nl|> Now will I in, to take some privy order, <|nl|> To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight; <|nl|> And to give notice, that no manner of person <|nl|> At any time have recourse unto the princes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Scrivener: <|nl|> This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings; <|nl|> Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd, <|nl|> That it may be this day read over in Paul's. <|nl|> And mark how well the sequel hangs together: <|nl|> Eleven hours I spent to write it over, <|nl|> For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me; <|nl|> The precedent was full as long a-doing: <|nl|> And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings, <|nl|> Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty <|nl|> Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross, <|nl|> That seeth not this palpable device? <|nl|> Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not? <|nl|> Bad is the world; and all will come to nought, <|nl|> When such bad dealings must be seen in thought. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> How now, my lord, what say the citizens? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Now, by the holy mother of our Lord, <|nl|> The citizens are mum and speak not a word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy, <|nl|> And his contract by deputy in France; <|nl|> The insatiate greediness of his desires, <|nl|> And his enforcement of the city wives; <|nl|> His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy, <|nl|> As being got, your father then in France, <|nl|> His resemblance, being not like the duke; <|nl|> Withal I did infer your lineaments, <|nl|> Being the right idea of your father, <|nl|> Both in your form and nobleness of mind; <|nl|> Laid open all your victories in Scotland, <|nl|> Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace, <|nl|> Your bounty, virtue, fair humility: <|nl|> Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose <|nl|> Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse <|nl|> And when mine oratory grew to an end <|nl|> I bid them that did love their country's good <|nl|> Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!' <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Ah! and did they so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> No, so God help me, they spake not a word; <|nl|> But, like dumb statues or breathing stones, <|nl|> Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale. <|nl|> Which when I saw, I reprehended them; <|nl|> And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence: <|nl|> His answer was, the people were not wont <|nl|> To be spoke to but by the recorder. <|nl|> Then he was urged to tell my tale again, <|nl|> 'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;' <|nl|> But nothing spake in warrant from himself. <|nl|> When he had done, some followers of mine own, <|nl|> At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps, <|nl|> And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!' <|nl|> And thus I took the vantage of those few, <|nl|> 'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I; <|nl|> 'This general applause and loving shout <|nl|> Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:' <|nl|> And even here brake off, and came away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> No, by my troth, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Will not the mayor then and his brethren come? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear; <|nl|> Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit: <|nl|> And look you get a prayer-book in your hand, <|nl|> And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord; <|nl|> For on that ground I'll build a holy descant: <|nl|> And be not easily won to our request: <|nl|> Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I go; and if you plead as well for them <|nl|> As I can say nay to thee for myself, <|nl|> No doubt well bring it to a happy issue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks. <|nl|> Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here; <|nl|> I think the duke will not be spoke withal. <|nl|> Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby, <|nl|> What says he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> My lord: he doth entreat your grace; <|nl|> To visit him to-morrow or next day: <|nl|> He is within, with two right reverend fathers, <|nl|> Divinely bent to meditation; <|nl|> And no worldly suit would he be moved, <|nl|> To draw him from his holy exercise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again; <|nl|> Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens, <|nl|> In deep designs and matters of great moment, <|nl|> No less importing than our general good, <|nl|> Are come to have some conference with his grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> I'll tell him what you say, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward! <|nl|> He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed, <|nl|> But on his knees at meditation; <|nl|> Not dallying with a brace of courtezans, <|nl|> But meditating with two deep divines; <|nl|> Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, <|nl|> But praying, to enrich his watchful soul: <|nl|> Happy were England, would this gracious prince <|nl|> Take on himself the sovereignty thereof: <|nl|> But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Mayor: <|nl|> Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> I fear he will. <|nl|> How now, Catesby, what says your lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> My lord, <|nl|> He wonders to what end you have assembled <|nl|> Such troops of citizens to speak with him, <|nl|> His grace not being warn'd thereof before: <|nl|> My lord, he fears you mean no good to him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Sorry I am my noble cousin should <|nl|> Suspect me, that I mean no good to him: <|nl|> By heaven, I come in perfect love to him; <|nl|> And so once more return and tell his grace. <|nl|> When holy and devout religious men <|nl|> Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence, <|nl|> So sweet is zealous contemplation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Mayor: <|nl|> See, where he stands between two clergymen! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Two props of virtue for a Christian prince, <|nl|> To stay him from the fall of vanity: <|nl|> And, see, a book of prayer in his hand, <|nl|> True ornaments to know a holy man. <|nl|> Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince, <|nl|> Lend favourable ears to our request; <|nl|> And pardon us the interruption <|nl|> Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> My lord, there needs no such apology: <|nl|> I rather do beseech you pardon me, <|nl|> Who, earnest in the service of my God, <|nl|> Neglect the visitation of my friends. <|nl|> But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above, <|nl|> And all good men of this ungovern'd isle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I do suspect I have done some offence <|nl|> That seems disgracious in the city's eyes, <|nl|> And that you come to reprehend my ignorance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> You have, my lord: would it might please your grace, <|nl|> At our entreaties, to amend that fault! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Then know, it is your fault that you resign <|nl|> The supreme seat, the throne majestical, <|nl|> The scepter'd office of your ancestors, <|nl|> Your state of fortune and your due of birth, <|nl|> The lineal glory of your royal house, <|nl|> To the corruption of a blemished stock: <|nl|> Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, <|nl|> Which here we waken to our country's good, <|nl|> This noble isle doth want her proper limbs; <|nl|> Her face defaced with scars of infamy, <|nl|> Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants, <|nl|> And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf <|nl|> Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion. <|nl|> Which to recure, we heartily solicit <|nl|> Your gracious self to take on you the charge <|nl|> And kingly government of this your land, <|nl|> Not as protector, steward, substitute, <|nl|> Or lowly factor for another's gain; <|nl|> But as successively from blood to blood, <|nl|> Your right of birth, your empery, your own. <|nl|> For this, consorted with the citizens, <|nl|> Your very worshipful and loving friends, <|nl|> And by their vehement instigation, <|nl|> In this just suit come I to move your grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I know not whether to depart in silence, <|nl|> Or bitterly to speak in your reproof. <|nl|> Best fitteth my degree or your condition <|nl|> If not to answer, you might haply think <|nl|> Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded <|nl|> To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, <|nl|> Which fondly you would here impose on me; <|nl|> If to reprove you for this suit of yours, <|nl|> So season'd with your faithful love to me. <|nl|> Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends. <|nl|> Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first, <|nl|> And then, in speaking, not to incur the last, <|nl|> Definitively thus I answer you. <|nl|> Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert <|nl|> Unmeritable shuns your high request. <|nl|> First if all obstacles were cut away, <|nl|> And that my path were even to the crown, <|nl|> As my ripe revenue and due by birth <|nl|> Yet so much is my poverty of spirit, <|nl|> So mighty and so many my defects, <|nl|> As I had rather hide me from my greatness, <|nl|> Being a bark to brook no mighty sea, <|nl|> Than in my greatness covet to be hid, <|nl|> And in the vapour of my glory smother'd. <|nl|> But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me, <|nl|> And much I need to help you, if need were; <|nl|> The royal tree hath left us royal fruit, <|nl|> Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time, <|nl|> Will well become the seat of majesty, <|nl|> And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign. <|nl|> On him I lay what you would lay on me, <|nl|> The right and fortune of his happy stars; <|nl|> Which God defend that I should wring from him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> My lord, this argues conscience in your grace; <|nl|> But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, <|nl|> All circumstances well considered. <|nl|> You say that Edward is your brother's son: <|nl|> So say we too, but not by Edward's wife; <|nl|> For first he was contract to Lady Lucy-- <|nl|> Your mother lives a witness to that vow-- <|nl|> And afterward by substitute betroth'd <|nl|> To Bona, sister to the King of France. <|nl|> These both put by a poor petitioner, <|nl|> A care-crazed mother of a many children, <|nl|> A beauty-waning and distressed widow, <|nl|> Even in the afternoon of her best days, <|nl|> Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye, <|nl|> Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts <|nl|> To base declension and loathed bigamy <|nl|> By her, in his unlawful bed, he got <|nl|> This Edward, whom our manners term the prince. <|nl|> More bitterly could I expostulate, <|nl|> Save that, for reverence to some alive, <|nl|> I give a sparing limit to my tongue. <|nl|> Then, good my lord, take to your royal self <|nl|> This proffer'd benefit of dignity; <|nl|> If non to bless us and the land withal, <|nl|> Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry <|nl|> From the corruption of abusing times, <|nl|> Unto a lineal true-derived course. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Mayor: <|nl|> Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Alas, why would you heap these cares on me? <|nl|> I am unfit for state and majesty; <|nl|> I do beseech you, take it not amiss; <|nl|> I cannot nor I will not yield to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal, <|nl|> Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son; <|nl|> As well we know your tenderness of heart <|nl|> And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse, <|nl|> Which we have noted in you to your kin, <|nl|> And egally indeed to all estates,-- <|nl|> Yet whether you accept our suit or no, <|nl|> Your brother's son shall never reign our king; <|nl|> But we will plant some other in the throne, <|nl|> To the disgrace and downfall of your house: <|nl|> And in this resolution here we leave you.-- <|nl|> Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANOTHER: <|nl|> Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Would you enforce me to a world of care? <|nl|> Well, call them again. I am not made of stone, <|nl|> But penetrable to your. kind entreats, <|nl|> Albeit against my conscience and my soul. <|nl|> Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men, <|nl|> Since you will buckle fortune on my back, <|nl|> To bear her burthen, whether I will or no, <|nl|> I must have patience to endure the load: <|nl|> But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach <|nl|> Attend the sequel of your imposition, <|nl|> Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me <|nl|> From all the impure blots and stains thereof; <|nl|> For God he knows, and you may partly see, <|nl|> How far I am from the desire thereof. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Mayor: <|nl|> God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> In saying so, you shall but say the truth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Then I salute you with this kingly title: <|nl|> Long live Richard, England's royal king! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Mayor: <|nl|> Amen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Even when you please, since you will have it so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace: <|nl|> And so most joyfully we take our leave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Come, let us to our holy task again. <|nl|> Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet <|nl|> Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester? <|nl|> Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower, <|nl|> On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes. <|nl|> Daughter, well met. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> God give your graces both <|nl|> A happy and a joyful time of day! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> As much to you, good sister! Whither away? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess, <|nl|> Upon the like devotion as yourselves, <|nl|> To gratulate the gentle princes there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together. <|nl|> And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes. <|nl|> Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave, <|nl|> How doth the prince, and my young son of York? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> Right well, dear madam. By your patience, <|nl|> I may not suffer you to visit them; <|nl|> The king hath straitly charged the contrary. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> The king! why, who's that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> The Lord protect him from that kingly title! <|nl|> Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me? <|nl|> I am their mother; who should keep me from them? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I am their fathers mother; I will see them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother: <|nl|> Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame <|nl|> And take thy office from thee, on my peril. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BRAKENBURY: <|nl|> No, madam, no; I may not leave it so: <|nl|> I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD STANLEY: <|nl|> Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence, <|nl|> And I'll salute your grace of York as mother, <|nl|> And reverend looker on, of two fair queens. <|nl|> Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster, <|nl|> There to be crowned Richard's royal queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart <|nl|> May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon <|nl|> With this dead-killing news! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORSET: <|nl|> Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence! <|nl|> Death and destruction dog thee at the heels; <|nl|> Thy mother's name is ominous to children. <|nl|> If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas, <|nl|> And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell <|nl|> Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house, <|nl|> Lest thou increase the number of the dead; <|nl|> And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse, <|nl|> Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD STANLEY: <|nl|> Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam. <|nl|> Take all the swift advantage of the hours; <|nl|> You shall have letters from me to my son <|nl|> To meet you on the way, and welcome you. <|nl|> Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> O ill-dispersing wind of misery! <|nl|> O my accursed womb, the bed of death! <|nl|> A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world, <|nl|> Whose unavoided eye is murderous. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD STANLEY: <|nl|> Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> And I in all unwillingness will go. <|nl|> I would to God that the inclusive verge <|nl|> Of golden metal that must round my brow <|nl|> Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain! <|nl|> Anointed let me be with deadly venom, <|nl|> And die, ere men can say, God save the queen! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory <|nl|> To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> No! why?  When he that is my husband now <|nl|> Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse, <|nl|> When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands <|nl|> Which issued from my other angel husband <|nl|> And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd; <|nl|> O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face, <|nl|> This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed, <|nl|> For making me, so young, so old a widow! <|nl|> And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed; <|nl|> And be thy wife--if any be so mad-- <|nl|> As miserable by the life of thee <|nl|> As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death! <|nl|> Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again, <|nl|> Even in so short a space, my woman's heart <|nl|> Grossly grew captive to his honey words <|nl|> And proved the subject of my own soul's curse, <|nl|> Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest; <|nl|> For never yet one hour in his bed <|nl|> Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep, <|nl|> But have been waked by his timorous dreams. <|nl|> Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick; <|nl|> And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> No more than from my soul I mourn for yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY ANNE: <|nl|> Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower. <|nl|> Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes <|nl|> Whom envy hath immured within your walls! <|nl|> Rough cradle for such little pretty ones! <|nl|> Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow <|nl|> For tender princes, use my babies well! <|nl|> So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> My gracious sovereign? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Give me thy hand. <|nl|> Thus high, by thy advice <|nl|> And thy assistance, is King Richard seated; <|nl|> But shall we wear these honours for a day? <|nl|> Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Still live they and for ever may they last! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> O Buckingham, now do I play the touch, <|nl|> To try if thou be current gold indeed <|nl|> Young Edward lives: think now what I would say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Say on, my loving lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king, <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> True, noble prince. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> O bitter consequence, <|nl|> That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!' <|nl|> Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull: <|nl|> Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead; <|nl|> And I would have it suddenly perform'd. <|nl|> What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Your grace may do your pleasure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth: <|nl|> Say, have I thy consent that they shall die? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord <|nl|> Before I positively herein: <|nl|> I will resolve your grace immediately. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> I will converse with iron-witted fools <|nl|> And unrespective boys: none are for me <|nl|> That look into me with considerate eyes: <|nl|> High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect. <|nl|> Boy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> My lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold <|nl|> Would tempt unto a close exploit of death? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> My lord, I know a discontented gentleman, <|nl|> Whose humble means match not his haughty mind: <|nl|> Gold were as good as twenty orators, <|nl|> And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> What is his name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> His name, my lord, is Tyrrel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> I partly know the man: go, call him hither. <|nl|> The deep-revolving witty Buckingham <|nl|> No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel: <|nl|> Hath he so long held out with me untired, <|nl|> And stops he now for breath? <|nl|> How now! what news with you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled <|nl|> To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea <|nl|> Where he abides. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Catesby! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> My lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Rumour it abroad <|nl|> That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die: <|nl|> I will take order for her keeping close. <|nl|> Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman, <|nl|> Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter: <|nl|> The boy is foolish, and I fear not him. <|nl|> Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out <|nl|> That Anne my wife is sick and like to die: <|nl|> About it; for it stands me much upon, <|nl|> To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me. <|nl|> I must be married to my brother's daughter, <|nl|> Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass. <|nl|> Murder her brothers, and then marry her! <|nl|> Uncertain way of gain! But I am in <|nl|> So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin: <|nl|> Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye. <|nl|> Is thy name Tyrrel? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Art thou, indeed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> Prove me, my gracious sovereign. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> Ay, my lord; <|nl|> But I had rather kill two enemies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies, <|nl|> Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers <|nl|> Are they that I would have thee deal upon: <|nl|> Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> Let me have open means to come to them, <|nl|> And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel <|nl|> Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear: <|nl|> There is no more but so: say it is done, <|nl|> And I will love thee, and prefer thee too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> 'Tis done, my gracious lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> Ye shall, my Lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind <|nl|> The late demand that you did sound me in. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> I hear that news, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise, <|nl|> For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd; <|nl|> The earldom of Hereford and the moveables <|nl|> The which you promised I should possess. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey <|nl|> Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> What says your highness to my just demand? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> As I remember, Henry the Sixth <|nl|> Did prophesy that Richmond should be king, <|nl|> When Richmond was a little peevish boy. <|nl|> A king, perhaps, perhaps,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> My lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> How chance the prophet could not at that time <|nl|> Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> My lord, your promise for the earldom,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Richmond! When last I was at Exeter, <|nl|> The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle, <|nl|> And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started, <|nl|> Because a bard of Ireland told me once <|nl|> I should not live long after I saw Richmond. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> My Lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Ay, what's o'clock? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> I am thus bold to put your grace in mind <|nl|> Of what you promised me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Well, but what's o'clock? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Upon the stroke of ten. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Well, let it strike. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Why let it strike? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke <|nl|> Betwixt thy begging and my meditation. <|nl|> I am not in the giving vein to-day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Why, then resolve me whether you will or no. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Tut, tut, <|nl|> Thou troublest me; am not in the vein. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Is it even so? rewards he my true service <|nl|> With such deep contempt made I him king for this? <|nl|> O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone <|nl|> To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> The tyrannous and bloody deed is done. <|nl|> The most arch of piteous massacre <|nl|> That ever yet this land was guilty of. <|nl|> Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn <|nl|> To do this ruthless piece of butchery, <|nl|> Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs, <|nl|> Melting with tenderness and kind compassion <|nl|> Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories. <|nl|> 'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:' <|nl|> 'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another <|nl|> Within their innocent alabaster arms: <|nl|> Their lips were four red roses on a stalk, <|nl|> Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other. <|nl|> A book of prayers on their pillow lay; <|nl|> Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind; <|nl|> But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd <|nl|> Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered <|nl|> The most replenished sweet work of nature, <|nl|> That from the prime creation e'er she framed.' <|nl|> Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse; <|nl|> They could not speak; and so I left them both, <|nl|> To bring this tidings to the bloody king. <|nl|> And here he comes. <|nl|> All hail, my sovereign liege! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> If to have done the thing you gave in charge <|nl|> Beget your happiness, be happy then, <|nl|> For it is done, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> But didst thou see them dead? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> I did, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> And buried, gentle Tyrrel? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYRREL: <|nl|> The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them; <|nl|> But how or in what place I do not know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper, <|nl|> And thou shalt tell the process of their death. <|nl|> Meantime, but think how I may do thee good, <|nl|> And be inheritor of thy desire. <|nl|> Farewell till soon. <|nl|> The son of Clarence have I pent up close; <|nl|> His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage; <|nl|> The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom, <|nl|> And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night. <|nl|> Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims <|nl|> At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter, <|nl|> And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown, <|nl|> To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> My lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond; <|nl|> And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen, <|nl|> Is in the field, and still his power increaseth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Ely with Richmond troubles me more near <|nl|> Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army. <|nl|> Come, I have heard that fearful commenting <|nl|> Is leaden servitor to dull delay; <|nl|> Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary <|nl|> Then fiery expedition be my wing, <|nl|> Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king! <|nl|> Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield; <|nl|> We must be brief when traitors brave the field. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> So, now prosperity begins to mellow <|nl|> And drop into the rotten mouth of death. <|nl|> Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd, <|nl|> To watch the waning of mine adversaries. <|nl|> A dire induction am I witness to, <|nl|> And will to France, hoping the consequence <|nl|> Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical. <|nl|> Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes! <|nl|> My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets! <|nl|> If yet your gentle souls fly in the air <|nl|> And be not fix'd in doom perpetual, <|nl|> Hover about me with your airy wings <|nl|> And hear your mother's lamentation! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Hover about her; say, that right for right <|nl|> Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> So many miseries have crazed my voice, <|nl|> That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb, <|nl|> Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet. <|nl|> Edward for Edward pays a dying debt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs, <|nl|> And throw them in the entrails of the wolf? <|nl|> When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> When holy Harry died, and my sweet son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost, <|nl|> Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd, <|nl|> Brief abstract and record of tedious days, <|nl|> Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth, <|nl|> Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave <|nl|> As thou canst yield a melancholy seat! <|nl|> Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here. <|nl|> O, who hath any cause to mourn but I? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> If ancient sorrow be most reverend, <|nl|> Give mine the benefit of seniory, <|nl|> And let my woes frown on the upper hand. <|nl|> If sorrow can admit society, <|nl|> Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine: <|nl|> I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him; <|nl|> I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him: <|nl|> Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him; <|nl|> Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him; <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him; <|nl|> I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him. <|nl|> From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept <|nl|> A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death: <|nl|> That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes, <|nl|> To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood, <|nl|> That foul defacer of God's handiwork, <|nl|> That excellent grand tyrant of the earth, <|nl|> That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls, <|nl|> Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves. <|nl|> O upright, just, and true-disposing God, <|nl|> How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur <|nl|> Preys on the issue of his mother's body, <|nl|> And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes! <|nl|> God witness with me, I have wept for thine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge, <|nl|> And now I cloy me with beholding it. <|nl|> Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward: <|nl|> Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; <|nl|> Young York he is but boot, because both they <|nl|> Match not the high perfection of my loss: <|nl|> Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward; <|nl|> And the beholders of this tragic play, <|nl|> The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, <|nl|> Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves. <|nl|> Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer, <|nl|> Only reserved their factor, to buy souls <|nl|> And send them thither: but at hand, at hand, <|nl|> Ensues his piteous and unpitied end: <|nl|> Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray. <|nl|> To have him suddenly convey'd away. <|nl|> Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey, <|nl|> That I may live to say, The dog is dead! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> O, thou didst prophesy the time would come <|nl|> That I should wish for thee to help me curse <|nl|> That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune; <|nl|> I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen; <|nl|> The presentation of but what I was; <|nl|> The flattering index of a direful pageant; <|nl|> One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below; <|nl|> A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes; <|nl|> A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble, <|nl|> A sign of dignity, a garish flag, <|nl|> To be the aim of every dangerous shot, <|nl|> A queen in jest, only to fill the scene. <|nl|> Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers? <|nl|> Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy? <|nl|> Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'? <|nl|> Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee? <|nl|> Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee? <|nl|> Decline all this, and see what now thou art: <|nl|> For happy wife, a most distressed widow; <|nl|> For joyful mother, one that wails the name; <|nl|> For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care; <|nl|> For one being sued to, one that humbly sues; <|nl|> For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me; <|nl|> For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one; <|nl|> For one commanding all, obey'd of none. <|nl|> Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about, <|nl|> And left thee but a very prey to time; <|nl|> Having no more but thought of what thou wert, <|nl|> To torture thee the more, being what thou art. <|nl|> Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not <|nl|> Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? <|nl|> Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke; <|nl|> From which even here I slip my weary neck, <|nl|> And leave the burthen of it all on thee. <|nl|> Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance: <|nl|> These English woes will make me smile in France. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile, <|nl|> And teach me how to curse mine enemies! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days; <|nl|> Compare dead happiness with living woe; <|nl|> Think that thy babes were fairer than they were, <|nl|> And he that slew them fouler than he is: <|nl|> Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse: <|nl|> Revolving this will teach thee how to curse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Why should calamity be full of words? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Windy attorneys to their client woes, <|nl|> Airy succeeders of intestate joys, <|nl|> Poor breathing orators of miseries! <|nl|> Let them have scope: though what they do impart <|nl|> Help not all, yet do they ease the heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me. <|nl|> And in the breath of bitter words let's smother <|nl|> My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd. <|nl|> I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Who intercepts my expedition? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> O, she that might have intercepted thee, <|nl|> By strangling thee in her accursed womb <|nl|> From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown, <|nl|> Where should be graven, if that right were right, <|nl|> The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown, <|nl|> And the dire death of my two sons and brothers? <|nl|> Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence? <|nl|> And little Ned Plantagenet, his son? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums! <|nl|> Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women <|nl|> Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say! <|nl|> Either be patient, and entreat me fair, <|nl|> Or with the clamorous report of war <|nl|> Thus will I drown your exclamations. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Art thou my son? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Then patiently hear my impatience. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Madam, I have a touch of your condition, <|nl|> Which cannot brook the accent of reproof. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> O, let me speak! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Do then: but I'll not hear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I will be mild and gentle in my speech. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> And brief, good mother; for I am in haste. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee, <|nl|> God knows, in anguish, pain and agony. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> And came I not at last to comfort you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well, <|nl|> Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell. <|nl|> A grievous burthen was thy birth to me; <|nl|> Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy; <|nl|> Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious, <|nl|> Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous, <|nl|> Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody, <|nl|> treacherous, <|nl|> More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred: <|nl|> What comfortable hour canst thou name, <|nl|> That ever graced me in thy company? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd <|nl|> your grace <|nl|> To breakfast once forth of my company. <|nl|> If I be so disgracious in your sight, <|nl|> Let me march on, and not offend your grace. <|nl|> Strike the drum. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I prithee, hear me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> You speak too bitterly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Hear me a word; <|nl|> For I shall never speak to thee again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> So. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance, <|nl|> Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror, <|nl|> Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish <|nl|> And never look upon thy face again. <|nl|> Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse; <|nl|> Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more <|nl|> Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st! <|nl|> My prayers on the adverse party fight; <|nl|> And there the little souls of Edward's children <|nl|> Whisper the spirits of thine enemies <|nl|> And promise them success and victory. <|nl|> Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end; <|nl|> Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse <|nl|> Abides in me; I say amen to all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> I have no more sons of the royal blood <|nl|> For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard, <|nl|> They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens; <|nl|> And therefore level not to hit their lives. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth, <|nl|> Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> And must she die for this? O, let her live, <|nl|> And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty; <|nl|> Slander myself as false to Edward's bed; <|nl|> Throw over her the veil of infamy: <|nl|> So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter, <|nl|> I will confess she was not Edward's daughter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> To save her life, I'll say she is not so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Her life is only safest in her birth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> And only in that safety died her brothers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Lo, at their births good stars were opposite. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> No, to their lives bad friends were contrary. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> All unavoided is the doom of destiny. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> True, when avoided grace makes destiny: <|nl|> My babes were destined to a fairer death, <|nl|> If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> You speak as if that I had slain my cousins. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd <|nl|> Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life. <|nl|> Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts, <|nl|> Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction: <|nl|> No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt <|nl|> Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, <|nl|> To revel in the entrails of my lambs. <|nl|> But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame, <|nl|> My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys <|nl|> Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes; <|nl|> And I, in such a desperate bay of death, <|nl|> Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft, <|nl|> Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise <|nl|> And dangerous success of bloody wars, <|nl|> As I intend more good to you and yours, <|nl|> Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> What good is cover'd with the face of heaven, <|nl|> To be discover'd, that can do me good? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> The advancement of your children, gentle lady. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> No, to the dignity and height of honour <|nl|> The high imperial type of this earth's glory. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Flatter my sorrows with report of it; <|nl|> Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour, <|nl|> Canst thou demise to any child of mine? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Even all I have; yea, and myself and all, <|nl|> Will I withal endow a child of thine; <|nl|> So in the Lethe of thy angry soul <|nl|> Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs <|nl|> Which thou supposest I have done to thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness <|nl|> Last longer telling than thy kindness' date. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> What do you think? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul: <|nl|> So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers; <|nl|> And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Be not so hasty to confound my meaning: <|nl|> I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter, <|nl|> And mean to make her queen of England. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Even he that makes her queen who should be else? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> What, thou? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> I, even I: what think you of it, madam? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> How canst thou woo her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> That would I learn of you, <|nl|> As one that are best acquainted with her humour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> And wilt thou learn of me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Madam, with all my heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers, <|nl|> A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave <|nl|> Edward and York; then haply she will weep: <|nl|> Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret <|nl|> Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,-- <|nl|> A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain <|nl|> The purple sap from her sweet brother's body <|nl|> And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith. <|nl|> If this inducement force her not to love, <|nl|> Send her a story of thy noble acts; <|nl|> Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence, <|nl|> Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake, <|nl|> Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way <|nl|> To win our daughter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> There is no other way <|nl|> Unless thou couldst put on some other shape, <|nl|> And not be Richard that hath done all this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Say that I did all this for love of her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee, <|nl|> Having bought love with such a bloody spoil. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Look, what is done cannot be now amended: <|nl|> Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, <|nl|> Which after hours give leisure to repent. <|nl|> If I did take the kingdom from your sons, <|nl|> To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter. <|nl|> If I have kill'd the issue of your womb, <|nl|> To quicken your increase, I will beget <|nl|> Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter <|nl|> A grandam's name is little less in love <|nl|> Than is the doting title of a mother; <|nl|> They are as children but one step below, <|nl|> Even of your mettle, of your very blood; <|nl|> Of an one pain, save for a night of groans <|nl|> Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow. <|nl|> Your children were vexation to your youth, <|nl|> But mine shall be a comfort to your age. <|nl|> The loss you have is but a son being king, <|nl|> And by that loss your daughter is made queen. <|nl|> I cannot make you what amends I would, <|nl|> Therefore accept such kindness as I can. <|nl|> Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul <|nl|> Leads discontented steps in foreign soil, <|nl|> This fair alliance quickly shall call home <|nl|> To high promotions and great dignity: <|nl|> The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife. <|nl|> Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother; <|nl|> Again shall you be mother to a king, <|nl|> And all the ruins of distressful times <|nl|> Repair'd with double riches of content. <|nl|> What! we have many goodly days to see: <|nl|> The liquid drops of tears that you have shed <|nl|> Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl, <|nl|> Advantaging their loan with interest <|nl|> Of ten times double gain of happiness. <|nl|> Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go <|nl|> Make bold her bashful years with your experience; <|nl|> Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale <|nl|> Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame <|nl|> Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess <|nl|> With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys <|nl|> And when this arm of mine hath chastised <|nl|> The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham, <|nl|> Bound with triumphant garlands will I come <|nl|> And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed; <|nl|> To whom I will retail my conquest won, <|nl|> And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> What were I best to say? her father's brother <|nl|> Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle? <|nl|> Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles? <|nl|> Under what title shall I woo for thee, <|nl|> That God, the law, my honour and her love, <|nl|> Can make seem pleasing to her tender years? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Infer fair England's peace by this alliance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Which she shall purchase with still lasting war. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Say that the king, which may command, entreats. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> That at her hands which the king's King forbids. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> To wail the tide, as her mother doth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Say, I will love her everlastingly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> But how long shall that title 'ever' last? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> So long as heaven and nature lengthens it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> So long as hell and Richard likes of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Be eloquent in my behalf to her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> An honest tale speeds best being plainly told. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Plain and not honest is too harsh a style. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Your reasons are too shallow and too quick. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> O no, my reasons are too deep and dead; <|nl|> Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Harp not on that string, madam; that is past. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> I swear-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> By nothing; for this is no oath: <|nl|> The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour; <|nl|> The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue; <|nl|> The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory. <|nl|> if something thou wilt swear to be believed, <|nl|> Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Now, by the world-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> My father's death-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Thy life hath that dishonour'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Then, by myself-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Thyself thyself misusest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Why then, by God-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> God's wrong is most of all. <|nl|> If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him, <|nl|> The unity the king thy brother made <|nl|> Had not been broken, nor my brother slain: <|nl|> If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him, <|nl|> The imperial metal, circling now thy brow, <|nl|> Had graced the tender temples of my child, <|nl|> And both the princes had been breathing here, <|nl|> Which now, two tender playfellows to dust, <|nl|> Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms. <|nl|> What canst thou swear by now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> The time to come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast; <|nl|> For I myself have many tears to wash <|nl|> Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee. <|nl|> The children live, whose parents thou hast <|nl|> slaughter'd, <|nl|> Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age; <|nl|> The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd, <|nl|> Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age. <|nl|> Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast <|nl|> Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> As I intend to prosper and repent, <|nl|> So thrive I in my dangerous attempt <|nl|> Of hostile arms! myself myself confound! <|nl|> Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours! <|nl|> Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest! <|nl|> Be opposite all planets of good luck <|nl|> To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love, <|nl|> Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts, <|nl|> I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter! <|nl|> In her consists my happiness and thine; <|nl|> Without her, follows to this land and me, <|nl|> To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul, <|nl|> Death, desolation, ruin and decay: <|nl|> It cannot be avoided but by this; <|nl|> It will not be avoided but by this. <|nl|> Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so-- <|nl|> Be the attorney of my love to her: <|nl|> Plead what I will be, not what I have been; <|nl|> Not my deserts, but what I will deserve: <|nl|> Urge the necessity and state of times, <|nl|> And be not peevish-fond in great designs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Shall I be tempted of the devil thus? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Shall I forget myself to be myself? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> But thou didst kill my children. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> But in your daughter's womb I bury them: <|nl|> Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed <|nl|> Selves of themselves, to your recomforture. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Shall I go win my daughter to thy will? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> And be a happy mother by the deed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> I go. Write to me very shortly. <|nl|> And you shall understand from me her mind. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell. <|nl|> Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman! <|nl|> How now! what news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> My gracious sovereign, on the western coast <|nl|> Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore <|nl|> Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends, <|nl|> Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back: <|nl|> 'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral; <|nl|> And there they hull, expecting but the aid <|nl|> Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk: <|nl|> Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> Here, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Fly to the duke: <|nl|> Post thou to Salisbury <|nl|> When thou comest thither-- <|nl|> Dull, unmindful villain, <|nl|> Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind, <|nl|> What from your grace I shall deliver to him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight <|nl|> The greatest strength and power he can make, <|nl|> And meet me presently at Salisbury. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> I go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at <|nl|> Salisbury? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> Your highness told me I should post before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed. <|nl|> How now, what news with you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing; <|nl|> Nor none so bad, but it may well be told. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad! <|nl|> Why dost thou run so many mile about, <|nl|> When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way? <|nl|> Once more, what news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> Richmond is on the seas. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> There let him sink, and be the seas on him! <|nl|> White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess? <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely, <|nl|> He makes for England, there to claim the crown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd? <|nl|> Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd? <|nl|> What heir of York is there alive but we? <|nl|> And who is England's king but great York's heir? <|nl|> Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea? <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Unless for that he comes to be your liege, <|nl|> You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes. <|nl|> Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Where is thy power, then, to beat him back? <|nl|> Where are thy tenants and thy followers? <|nl|> Are they not now upon the western shore. <|nl|> Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships! <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> No, my good lord, my friends are in the north. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north, <|nl|> When they should serve their sovereign in the west? <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign: <|nl|> Please it your majesty to give me leave, <|nl|> I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace <|nl|> Where and what time your majesty shall please. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond: <|nl|> I will not trust you, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> Most mighty sovereign, <|nl|> You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful: <|nl|> I never was nor never will be false. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Well, <|nl|> Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind <|nl|> Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm. <|nl|> Or else his head's assurance is but frail. <|nl|>  <|nl|> STANLEY: <|nl|> So deal with him as I prove true to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire, <|nl|> As I by friends am well advertised, <|nl|> Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughty prelate <|nl|> Bishop of Exeter, his brother there, <|nl|> With many more confederates, are in arms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Messenger: <|nl|> My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms; <|nl|> And every hour more competitors <|nl|> Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Messenger: <|nl|> My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death? <|nl|> Take that, until thou bring me better news. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Messenger: <|nl|> The news I have to tell your majesty <|nl|> Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters, <|nl|> Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd; <|nl|> And he himself wander'd away alone, <|nl|> No man knows whither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> I cry thee mercy: <|nl|> There is my purse to cure that blow of thine. <|nl|> Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd <|nl|> Reward to him that brings the traitor in? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Messenger: <|nl|> Such proclamation hath been made, my liege. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Fourth Messenger: <|nl|> Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset, <|nl|> 'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms. <|nl|> Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace, <|nl|> The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest: <|nl|> Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat <|nl|> Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks <|nl|> If they were his assistants, yea or no; <|nl|> Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham. <|nl|> Upon his party: he, mistrusting them, <|nl|> Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> March on, march on, since we are up in arms; <|nl|> If not to fight with foreign enemies, <|nl|> Yet to beat down these rebels here at home. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken; <|nl|> That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond <|nl|> Is with a mighty power landed at Milford, <|nl|> Is colder tidings, yet they must be told. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here, <|nl|> A royal battle might be won and lost <|nl|> Some one take order Buckingham be brought <|nl|> To Salisbury; the rest march on with me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me: <|nl|> That in the sty of this most bloody boar <|nl|> My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold: <|nl|> If I revolt, off goes young George's head; <|nl|> The fear of that withholds my present aid. <|nl|> But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CHRISTOPHER: <|nl|> At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> What men of name resort to him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CHRISTOPHER: <|nl|> Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; <|nl|> Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley; <|nl|> Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt, <|nl|> And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew; <|nl|> And many more of noble fame and worth: <|nl|> And towards London they do bend their course, <|nl|> If by the way they be not fought withal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> Return unto thy lord; commend me to him: <|nl|> Tell him the queen hath heartily consented <|nl|> He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter. <|nl|> These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Will not King Richard let me speak with him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Sheriff: <|nl|> No, my good lord; therefore be patient. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey, <|nl|> Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward, <|nl|> Vaughan, and all that have miscarried <|nl|> By underhand corrupted foul injustice, <|nl|> If that your moody discontented souls <|nl|> Do through the clouds behold this present hour, <|nl|> Even for revenge mock my destruction! <|nl|> This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Sheriff: <|nl|> It is, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|> Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday. <|nl|> This is the day that, in King Edward's time, <|nl|> I wish't might fall on me, when I was found <|nl|> False to his children or his wife's allies <|nl|> This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall <|nl|> By the false faith of him I trusted most; <|nl|> This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul <|nl|> Is the determined respite of my wrongs: <|nl|> That high All-Seer that I dallied with <|nl|> Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head <|nl|> And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest. <|nl|> Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men <|nl|> To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms: <|nl|> Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head; <|nl|> 'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow, <|nl|> Remember Margaret was a prophetess.' <|nl|> Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame; <|nl|> Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends, <|nl|> Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny, <|nl|> Thus far into the bowels of the land <|nl|> Have we march'd on without impediment; <|nl|> And here receive we from our father Stanley <|nl|> Lines of fair comfort and encouragement. <|nl|> The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar, <|nl|> That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines, <|nl|> Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough <|nl|> In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine <|nl|> Lies now even in the centre of this isle, <|nl|> Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn <|nl|> From Tamworth thither is but one day's march. <|nl|> In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends, <|nl|> To reap the harvest of perpetual peace <|nl|> By this one bloody trial of sharp war. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> Every man's conscience is a thousand swords, <|nl|> To fight against that bloody homicide. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERBERT: <|nl|> I doubt not but his friends will fly to us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BLUNT: <|nl|> He hath no friends but who are friends for fear. <|nl|> Which in his greatest need will shrink from him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march: <|nl|> True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings: <|nl|> Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field. <|nl|> My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SURREY: <|nl|> My heart is ten times lighter than my looks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> My Lord of Norfolk,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> Here, most gracious liege. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> We must both give and take, my gracious lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight; <|nl|> But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that. <|nl|> Who hath descried the number of the foe? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> Six or seven thousand is their utmost power. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Why, our battalion trebles that account: <|nl|> Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength, <|nl|> Which they upon the adverse party want. <|nl|> Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen, <|nl|> Let us survey the vantage of the field <|nl|> Call for some men of sound direction <|nl|> Let's want no discipline, make no delay, <|nl|> For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> The weary sun hath made a golden set, <|nl|> And by the bright track of his fiery car, <|nl|> Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow. <|nl|> Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard. <|nl|> Give me some ink and paper in my tent <|nl|> I'll draw the form and model of our battle, <|nl|> Limit each leader to his several charge, <|nl|> And part in just proportion our small strength. <|nl|> My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon, <|nl|> And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me. <|nl|> The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment: <|nl|> Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him <|nl|> And by the second hour in the morning <|nl|> Desire the earl to see me in my tent: <|nl|> Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st, <|nl|> Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BLUNT: <|nl|> Unless I have mista'en his colours much, <|nl|> Which well I am assured I have not done, <|nl|> His regiment lies half a mile at least <|nl|> South from the mighty power of the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> If without peril it be possible, <|nl|> Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him, <|nl|> And give him from me this most needful scroll. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BLUNT: <|nl|> Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it; <|nl|> And so, God give you quiet rest to-night! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen, <|nl|> Let us consult upon to-morrow's business <|nl|> In to our tent; the air is raw and cold. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> What is't o'clock? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> It's supper-time, my lord; <|nl|> It's nine o'clock. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> I will not sup to-night. <|nl|> Give me some ink and paper. <|nl|> What, is my beaver easier than it was? <|nl|> And all my armour laid into my tent? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge; <|nl|> Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> I go, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> I warrant you, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Catesby! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> My lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Send out a pursuivant at arms <|nl|> To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power <|nl|> Before sunrising, lest his son George fall <|nl|> Into the blind cave of eternal night. <|nl|> Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch. <|nl|> Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow. <|nl|> Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy. <|nl|> Ratcliff! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> My lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself, <|nl|> Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop <|nl|> Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine: <|nl|> I have not that alacrity of spirit, <|nl|> Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have. <|nl|> Set it down. Is ink and paper ready? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> It is, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Bid my guard watch; leave me. <|nl|> Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent <|nl|> And help to arm me. Leave me, I say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> Fortune and victory sit on thy helm! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> All comfort that the dark night can afford <|nl|> Be to thy person, noble father-in-law! <|nl|> Tell me, how fares our loving mother? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother <|nl|> Who prays continually for Richmond's good: <|nl|> So much for that. The silent hours steal on, <|nl|> And flaky darkness breaks within the east. <|nl|> In brief,--for so the season bids us be,-- <|nl|> Prepare thy battle early in the morning, <|nl|> And put thy fortune to the arbitrement <|nl|> Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war. <|nl|> I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,-- <|nl|> With best advantage will deceive the time, <|nl|> And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms: <|nl|> But on thy side I may not be too forward <|nl|> Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George, <|nl|> Be executed in his father's sight. <|nl|> Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time <|nl|> Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love <|nl|> And ample interchange of sweet discourse, <|nl|> Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon: <|nl|> God give us leisure for these rites of love! <|nl|> Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> Good lords, conduct him to his regiment: <|nl|> I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap, <|nl|> Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow, <|nl|> When I should mount with wings of victory: <|nl|> Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen. <|nl|> O Thou, whose captain I account myself, <|nl|> Look on my forces with a gracious eye; <|nl|> Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath, <|nl|> That they may crush down with a heavy fall <|nl|> The usurping helmets of our adversaries! <|nl|> Make us thy ministers of chastisement, <|nl|> That we may praise thee in the victory! <|nl|> To thee I do commend my watchful soul, <|nl|> Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes: <|nl|> Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghost of Prince Edward: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghost of King Henry VI: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghost of CLARENCE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghost of RIVERS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghost of GREY: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghost of VAUGHAN: <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghost of HASTINGS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghosts of young Princes: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghost of LADY ANNE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Ghost of BUCKINGHAM: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Give me another horse: bind up my wounds. <|nl|> Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream. <|nl|> O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me! <|nl|> The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight. <|nl|> Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh. <|nl|> What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by: <|nl|> Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I. <|nl|> Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am: <|nl|> Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why: <|nl|> Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself? <|nl|> Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good <|nl|> That I myself have done unto myself? <|nl|> O, no! alas, I rather hate myself <|nl|> For hateful deeds committed by myself! <|nl|> I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not. <|nl|> Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter. <|nl|> My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, <|nl|> And every tongue brings in a several tale, <|nl|> And every tale condemns me for a villain. <|nl|> Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree <|nl|> Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree; <|nl|> All several sins, all used in each degree, <|nl|> Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty! <|nl|> I shall despair. There is no creature loves me; <|nl|> And if I die, no soul shall pity me: <|nl|> Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself <|nl|> Find in myself no pity to myself? <|nl|> Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd <|nl|> Came to my tent; and every one did threat <|nl|> To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> My lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> 'Zounds! who is there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock <|nl|> Hath twice done salutation to the morn; <|nl|> Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream! <|nl|> What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> No doubt, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night <|nl|> Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard <|nl|> Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers <|nl|> Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond. <|nl|> It is not yet near day. Come, go with me; <|nl|> Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper, <|nl|> To see if any mean to shrink from me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORDS: <|nl|> Good morrow, Richmond! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen, <|nl|> That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORDS: <|nl|> How have you slept, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams <|nl|> That ever enter'd in a drowsy head, <|nl|> Have I since your departure had, my lords. <|nl|> Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd, <|nl|> Came to my tent, and cried on victory: <|nl|> I promise you, my soul is very jocund <|nl|> In the remembrance of so fair a dream. <|nl|> How far into the morning is it, lords? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORDS: <|nl|> Upon the stroke of four. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction. <|nl|> More than I have said, loving countrymen, <|nl|> The leisure and enforcement of the time <|nl|> Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this, <|nl|> God and our good cause fight upon our side; <|nl|> The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, <|nl|> Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces; <|nl|> Richard except, those whom we fight against <|nl|> Had rather have us win than him they follow: <|nl|> For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen, <|nl|> A bloody tyrant and a homicide; <|nl|> One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd; <|nl|> One that made means to come by what he hath, <|nl|> And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him; <|nl|> Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil <|nl|> Of England's chair, where he is falsely set; <|nl|> One that hath ever been God's enemy: <|nl|> Then, if you fight against God's enemy, <|nl|> God will in justice ward you as his soldiers; <|nl|> If you do sweat to put a tyrant down, <|nl|> You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain; <|nl|> If you do fight against your country's foes, <|nl|> Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire; <|nl|> If you do fight in safeguard of your wives, <|nl|> Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors; <|nl|> If you do free your children from the sword, <|nl|> Your children's children quit it in your age. <|nl|> Then, in the name of God and all these rights, <|nl|> Advance your standards, draw your willing swords. <|nl|> For me, the ransom of my bold attempt <|nl|> Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face; <|nl|> But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt <|nl|> The least of you shall share his part thereof. <|nl|> Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully; <|nl|> God and Saint George! Richmond and victory! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> What said Northumberland as touching Richmond? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> That he was never trained up in arms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> He said the truth: and what said Surrey then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> He was in the right; and so indeed it is. <|nl|> Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar. <|nl|> Who saw the sun to-day? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> Not I, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Then he disdains to shine; for by the book <|nl|> He should have braved the east an hour ago <|nl|> A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RATCLIFF: <|nl|> My lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> The sun will not be seen to-day; <|nl|> The sky doth frown and lour upon our army. <|nl|> I would these dewy tears were from the ground. <|nl|> Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me <|nl|> More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven <|nl|> That frowns on me looks sadly upon him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse. <|nl|> Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power: <|nl|> I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain, <|nl|> And thus my battle shall be ordered: <|nl|> My foreward shall be drawn out all in length, <|nl|> Consisting equally of horse and foot; <|nl|> Our archers shall be placed in the midst <|nl|> John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey, <|nl|> Shall have the leading of this foot and horse. <|nl|> They thus directed, we will follow <|nl|> In the main battle, whose puissance on either side <|nl|> Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse. <|nl|> This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> A good direction, warlike sovereign. <|nl|> This found I on my tent this morning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> My lord, he doth deny to come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Off with his son George's head! <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> My lord, the enemy is past the marsh <|nl|> After the battle let George Stanley die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> A thousand hearts are great within my bosom: <|nl|> Advance our standards, set upon our foes <|nl|> Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George, <|nl|> Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons! <|nl|> Upon them! victory sits on our helms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue! <|nl|> The king enacts more wonders than a man, <|nl|> Daring an opposite to every danger: <|nl|> His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, <|nl|> Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death. <|nl|> Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CATESBY: <|nl|> Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD III: <|nl|> Slave, I have set my life upon a cast, <|nl|> And I will stand the hazard of the die: <|nl|> I think there be six Richmonds in the field; <|nl|> Five have I slain to-day instead of him. <|nl|> A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> God and your arms be praised, victorious friends, <|nl|> The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee. <|nl|> Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty <|nl|> From the dead temples of this bloody wretch <|nl|> Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal: <|nl|> Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> Great God of heaven, say Amen to all! <|nl|> But, tell me, is young George Stanley living? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town; <|nl|> Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> What men of name are slain on either side? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DERBY: <|nl|> John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers, <|nl|> Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHMOND: <|nl|> Inter their bodies as becomes their births: <|nl|> Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled <|nl|> That in submission will return to us: <|nl|> And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament, <|nl|> We will unite the white rose and the red: <|nl|> Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction, <|nl|> That long have frown'd upon their enmity! <|nl|> What traitor hears me, and says not amen? <|nl|> England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself; <|nl|> The brother blindly shed the brother's blood, <|nl|> The father rashly slaughter'd his own son, <|nl|> The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire: <|nl|> All this divided York and Lancaster, <|nl|> Divided in their dire division, <|nl|> O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth, <|nl|> The true succeeders of each royal house, <|nl|> By God's fair ordinance conjoin together! <|nl|> And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so. <|nl|> Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace, <|nl|> With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days! <|nl|> Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, <|nl|> That would reduce these bloody days again, <|nl|> And make poor England weep in streams of blood! <|nl|> Let them not live to taste this land's increase <|nl|> That would with treason wound this fair land's peace! <|nl|> Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again: <|nl|> That she may long live here, God say amen! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster, <|nl|> Hast thou, according to thy oath and band, <|nl|> Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son, <|nl|> Here to make good the boisterous late appeal, <|nl|> Which then our leisure would not let us hear, <|nl|> Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> I have, my liege. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him, <|nl|> If he appeal the duke on ancient malice; <|nl|> Or worthily, as a good subject should, <|nl|> On some known ground of treachery in him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> As near as I could sift him on that argument, <|nl|> On some apparent danger seen in him <|nl|> Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Then call them to our presence; face to face, <|nl|> And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear <|nl|> The accuser and the accused freely speak: <|nl|> High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire, <|nl|> In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Many years of happy days befal <|nl|> My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege! <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> Each day still better other's happiness; <|nl|> Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap, <|nl|> Add an immortal title to your crown! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> We thank you both: yet one but flatters us, <|nl|> As well appeareth by the cause you come; <|nl|> Namely to appeal each other of high treason. <|nl|> Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object <|nl|> Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> First, heaven be the record to my speech! <|nl|> In the devotion of a subject's love, <|nl|> Tendering the precious safety of my prince, <|nl|> And free from other misbegotten hate, <|nl|> Come I appellant to this princely presence. <|nl|> Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee, <|nl|> And mark my greeting well; for what I speak <|nl|> My body shall make good upon this earth, <|nl|> Or my divine soul answer it in heaven. <|nl|> Thou art a traitor and a miscreant, <|nl|> Too good to be so and too bad to live, <|nl|> Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, <|nl|> The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly. <|nl|> Once more, the more to aggravate the note, <|nl|> With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat; <|nl|> And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move, <|nl|> What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove. <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal: <|nl|> 'Tis not the trial of a woman's war, <|nl|> The bitter clamour of two eager tongues, <|nl|> Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain; <|nl|> The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this: <|nl|> Yet can I not of such tame patience boast <|nl|> As to be hush'd and nought at all to say: <|nl|> First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me <|nl|> From giving reins and spurs to my free speech; <|nl|> Which else would post until it had return'd <|nl|> These terms of treason doubled down his throat. <|nl|> Setting aside his high blood's royalty, <|nl|> And let him be no kinsman to my liege, <|nl|> I do defy him, and I spit at him; <|nl|> Call him a slanderous coward and a villain: <|nl|> Which to maintain I would allow him odds, <|nl|> And meet him, were I tied to run afoot <|nl|> Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps, <|nl|> Or any other ground inhabitable, <|nl|> Where ever Englishman durst set his foot. <|nl|> Mean time let this defend my loyalty, <|nl|> By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage, <|nl|> Disclaiming here the kindred of the king, <|nl|> And lay aside my high blood's royalty, <|nl|> Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except. <|nl|> If guilty dread have left thee so much strength <|nl|> As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop: <|nl|> By that and all the rites of knighthood else, <|nl|> Will I make good against thee, arm to arm, <|nl|> What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> I take it up; and by that sword I swear <|nl|> Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder, <|nl|> I'll answer thee in any fair degree, <|nl|> Or chivalrous design of knightly trial: <|nl|> And when I mount, alive may I not light, <|nl|> If I be traitor or unjustly fight! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge? <|nl|> It must be great that can inherit us <|nl|> So much as of a thought of ill in him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true; <|nl|> That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles <|nl|> In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers, <|nl|> The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments, <|nl|> Like a false traitor and injurious villain. <|nl|> Besides I say and will in battle prove, <|nl|> Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge <|nl|> That ever was survey'd by English eye, <|nl|> That all the treasons for these eighteen years <|nl|> Complotted and contrived in this land <|nl|> Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring. <|nl|> Further I say and further will maintain <|nl|> Upon his bad life to make all this good, <|nl|> That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death, <|nl|> Suggest his soon-believing adversaries, <|nl|> And consequently, like a traitor coward, <|nl|> Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood: <|nl|> Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries, <|nl|> Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth, <|nl|> To me for justice and rough chastisement; <|nl|> And, by the glorious worth of my descent, <|nl|> This arm shall do it, or this life be spent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> How high a pitch his resolution soars! <|nl|> Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> O, let my sovereign turn away his face <|nl|> And bid his ears a little while be deaf, <|nl|> Till I have told this slander of his blood, <|nl|> How God and good men hate so foul a liar. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears: <|nl|> Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir, <|nl|> As he is but my father's brother's son, <|nl|> Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow, <|nl|> Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood <|nl|> Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize <|nl|> The unstooping firmness of my upright soul: <|nl|> He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou: <|nl|> Free speech and fearless I to thee allow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart, <|nl|> Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest. <|nl|> Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais <|nl|> Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers; <|nl|> The other part reserved I by consent, <|nl|> For that my sovereign liege was in my debt <|nl|> Upon remainder of a dear account, <|nl|> Since last I went to France to fetch his queen: <|nl|> Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death, <|nl|> I slew him not; but to my own disgrace <|nl|> Neglected my sworn duty in that case. <|nl|> For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster, <|nl|> The honourable father to my foe <|nl|> Once did I lay an ambush for your life, <|nl|> A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul <|nl|> But ere I last received the sacrament <|nl|> I did confess it, and exactly begg'd <|nl|> Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it. <|nl|> This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd, <|nl|> It issues from the rancour of a villain, <|nl|> A recreant and most degenerate traitor <|nl|> Which in myself I boldly will defend; <|nl|> And interchangeably hurl down my gage <|nl|> Upon this overweening traitor's foot, <|nl|> To prove myself a loyal gentleman <|nl|> Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom. <|nl|> In haste whereof, most heartily I pray <|nl|> Your highness to assign our trial day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me; <|nl|> Let's purge this choler without letting blood: <|nl|> This we prescribe, though no physician; <|nl|> Deep malice makes too deep incision; <|nl|> Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed; <|nl|> Our doctors say this is no month to bleed. <|nl|> Good uncle, let this end where it begun; <|nl|> We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> To be a make-peace shall become my age: <|nl|> Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> And, Norfolk, throw down his. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> When, Harry, when? <|nl|> Obedience bids I should not bid again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot. <|nl|> My life thou shalt command, but not my shame: <|nl|> The one my duty owes; but my fair name, <|nl|> Despite of death that lives upon my grave, <|nl|> To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have. <|nl|> I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here, <|nl|> Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear, <|nl|> The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood <|nl|> Which breathed this poison. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Rage must be withstood: <|nl|> Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame. <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame. <|nl|> And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord, <|nl|> The purest treasure mortal times afford <|nl|> Is spotless reputation: that away, <|nl|> Men are but gilded loam or painted clay. <|nl|> A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest <|nl|> Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast. <|nl|> Mine honour is my life; both grow in one: <|nl|> Take honour from me, and my life is done: <|nl|> Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try; <|nl|> In that I live and for that will I die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> O, God defend my soul from such deep sin! <|nl|> Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight? <|nl|> Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height <|nl|> Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue <|nl|> Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong, <|nl|> Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear <|nl|> The slavish motive of recanting fear, <|nl|> And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace, <|nl|> Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> We were not born to sue, but to command; <|nl|> Which since we cannot do to make you friends, <|nl|> Be ready, as your lives shall answer it, <|nl|> At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day: <|nl|> There shall your swords and lances arbitrate <|nl|> The swelling difference of your settled hate: <|nl|> Since we can not atone you, we shall see <|nl|> Justice design the victor's chivalry. <|nl|> Lord marshal, command our officers at arms <|nl|> Be ready to direct these home alarms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood <|nl|> Doth more solicit me than your exclaims, <|nl|> To stir against the butchers of his life! <|nl|> But since correction lieth in those hands <|nl|> Which made the fault that we cannot correct, <|nl|> Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven; <|nl|> Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth, <|nl|> Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS: <|nl|> Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur? <|nl|> Hath love in thy old blood no living fire? <|nl|> Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one, <|nl|> Were as seven vials of his sacred blood, <|nl|> Or seven fair branches springing from one root: <|nl|> Some of those seven are dried by nature's course, <|nl|> Some of those branches by the Destinies cut; <|nl|> But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester, <|nl|> One vial full of Edward's sacred blood, <|nl|> One flourishing branch of his most royal root, <|nl|> Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt, <|nl|> Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded, <|nl|> By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe. <|nl|> Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb, <|nl|> That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee <|nl|> Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest, <|nl|> Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent <|nl|> In some large measure to thy father's death, <|nl|> In that thou seest thy wretched brother die, <|nl|> Who was the model of thy father's life. <|nl|> Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair: <|nl|> In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd, <|nl|> Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, <|nl|> Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee: <|nl|> That which in mean men we intitle patience <|nl|> Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts. <|nl|> What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life, <|nl|> The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute, <|nl|> His deputy anointed in His sight, <|nl|> Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully, <|nl|> Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift <|nl|> An angry arm against His minister. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS: <|nl|> Where then, alas, may I complain myself? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> To God, the widow's champion and defence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS: <|nl|> Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt. <|nl|> Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold <|nl|> Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight: <|nl|> O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear, <|nl|> That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast! <|nl|> Or, if misfortune miss the first career, <|nl|> Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom, <|nl|> They may break his foaming courser's back, <|nl|> And throw the rider headlong in the lists, <|nl|> A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford! <|nl|> Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife <|nl|> With her companion grief must end her life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry: <|nl|> As much good stay with thee as go with me! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS: <|nl|> Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls, <|nl|> Not with the empty hollowness, but weight: <|nl|> I take my leave before I have begun, <|nl|> For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done. <|nl|> Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York. <|nl|> Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so; <|nl|> Though this be all, do not so quickly go; <|nl|> I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?-- <|nl|> With all good speed at Plashy visit me. <|nl|> Alack, and what shall good old York there see <|nl|> But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls, <|nl|> Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones? <|nl|> And what hear there for welcome but my groans? <|nl|> Therefore commend me; let him not come there, <|nl|> To seek out sorrow that dwells every where. <|nl|> Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die: <|nl|> The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold, <|nl|> Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay <|nl|> For nothing but his majesty's approach. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Marshal, demand of yonder champion <|nl|> The cause of his arrival here in arms: <|nl|> Ask him his name and orderly proceed <|nl|> To swear him in the justice of his cause. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> In God's name and the king's, say who thou art <|nl|> And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms, <|nl|> Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel: <|nl|> Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath; <|nl|> As so defend thee heaven and thy valour! <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk; <|nl|> Who hither come engaged by my oath-- <|nl|> Which God defend a knight should violate!-- <|nl|> Both to defend my loyalty and truth <|nl|> To God, my king and my succeeding issue, <|nl|> Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me <|nl|> And, by the grace of God and this mine arm, <|nl|> To prove him, in defending of myself, <|nl|> A traitor to my God, my king, and me: <|nl|> And as I truly fight, defend me heaven! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms, <|nl|> Both who he is and why he cometh hither <|nl|> Thus plated in habiliments of war, <|nl|> And formally, according to our law, <|nl|> Depose him in the justice of his cause. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither, <|nl|> Before King Richard in his royal lists? <|nl|> Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel? <|nl|> Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby <|nl|> Am I; who ready here do stand in arms, <|nl|> To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour, <|nl|> In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, <|nl|> That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous, <|nl|> To God of heaven, King Richard and to me; <|nl|> And as I truly fight, defend me heaven! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> On pain of death, no person be so bold <|nl|> Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists, <|nl|> Except the marshal and such officers <|nl|> Appointed to direct these fair designs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand, <|nl|> And bow my knee before his majesty: <|nl|> For Mowbray and myself are like two men <|nl|> That vow a long and weary pilgrimage; <|nl|> Then let us take a ceremonious leave <|nl|> And loving farewell of our several friends. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> The appellant in all duty greets your highness, <|nl|> And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> We will descend and fold him in our arms. <|nl|> Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right, <|nl|> So be thy fortune in this royal fight! <|nl|> Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed, <|nl|> Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> O let no noble eye profane a tear <|nl|> For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear: <|nl|> As confident as is the falcon's flight <|nl|> Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight. <|nl|> My loving lord, I take my leave of you; <|nl|> Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle; <|nl|> Not sick, although I have to do with death, <|nl|> But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath. <|nl|> Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet <|nl|> The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet: <|nl|> O thou, the earthly author of my blood, <|nl|> Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate, <|nl|> Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up <|nl|> To reach at victory above my head, <|nl|> Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers; <|nl|> And with thy blessings steel my lance's point, <|nl|> That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat, <|nl|> And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt, <|nl|> Even in the lusty havior of his son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> God in thy good cause make thee prosperous! <|nl|> Be swift like lightning in the execution; <|nl|> And let thy blows, doubly redoubled, <|nl|> Fall like amazing thunder on the casque <|nl|> Of thy adverse pernicious enemy: <|nl|> Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive! <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> However God or fortune cast my lot, <|nl|> There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne, <|nl|> A loyal, just and upright gentleman: <|nl|> Never did captive with a freer heart <|nl|> Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace <|nl|> His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement, <|nl|> More than my dancing soul doth celebrate <|nl|> This feast of battle with mine adversary. <|nl|> Most mighty liege, and my companion peers, <|nl|> Take from my mouth the wish of happy years: <|nl|> As gentle and as jocund as to jest <|nl|> Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Farewell, my lord: securely I espy <|nl|> Virtue with valour couched in thine eye. <|nl|> Order the trial, marshal, and begin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby, <|nl|> Receive thy lance; and God defend the right! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Herald: <|nl|> Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby, <|nl|> Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself, <|nl|> On pain to be found false and recreant, <|nl|> To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, <|nl|> A traitor to his God, his king and him; <|nl|> And dares him to set forward to the fight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Herald: <|nl|> Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, <|nl|> On pain to be found false and recreant, <|nl|> Both to defend himself and to approve <|nl|> Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, <|nl|> To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal; <|nl|> Courageously and with a free desire <|nl|> Attending but the signal to begin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants. <|nl|> Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Let them lay by their helmets and their spears, <|nl|> And both return back to their chairs again: <|nl|> Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound <|nl|> While we return these dukes what we decree. <|nl|> Draw near, <|nl|> And list what with our council we have done. <|nl|> For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd <|nl|> With that dear blood which it hath fostered; <|nl|> And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect <|nl|> Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword; <|nl|> And for we think the eagle-winged pride <|nl|> Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts, <|nl|> With rival-hating envy, set on you <|nl|> To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle <|nl|> Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep; <|nl|> Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums, <|nl|> With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray, <|nl|> And grating shock of wrathful iron arms, <|nl|> Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace <|nl|> And make us wade even in our kindred's blood, <|nl|> Therefore, we banish you our territories: <|nl|> You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life, <|nl|> Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields <|nl|> Shall not regreet our fair dominions, <|nl|> But tread the stranger paths of banishment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Your will be done: this must my comfort be, <|nl|> Sun that warms you here shall shine on me; <|nl|> And those his golden beams to you here lent <|nl|> Shall point on me and gild my banishment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom, <|nl|> Which I with some unwillingness pronounce: <|nl|> The sly slow hours shall not determinate <|nl|> The dateless limit of thy dear exile; <|nl|> The hopeless word of 'never to return' <|nl|> Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege, <|nl|> And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth: <|nl|> A dearer merit, not so deep a maim <|nl|> As to be cast forth in the common air, <|nl|> Have I deserved at your highness' hands. <|nl|> The language I have learn'd these forty years, <|nl|> My native English, now I must forego: <|nl|> And now my tongue's use is to me no more <|nl|> Than an unstringed viol or a harp, <|nl|> Or like a cunning instrument cased up, <|nl|> Or, being open, put into his hands <|nl|> That knows no touch to tune the harmony: <|nl|> Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue, <|nl|> Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips; <|nl|> And dull unfeeling barren ignorance <|nl|> Is made my gaoler to attend on me. <|nl|> I am too old to fawn upon a nurse, <|nl|> Too far in years to be a pupil now: <|nl|> What is thy sentence then but speechless death, <|nl|> Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> It boots thee not to be compassionate: <|nl|> After our sentence plaining comes too late. <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> Then thus I turn me from my country's light, <|nl|> To dwell in solemn shades of endless night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Return again, and take an oath with thee. <|nl|> Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands; <|nl|> Swear by the duty that you owe to God-- <|nl|> Our part therein we banish with yourselves-- <|nl|> To keep the oath that we administer: <|nl|> You never shall, so help you truth and God! <|nl|> Embrace each other's love in banishment; <|nl|> Nor never look upon each other's face; <|nl|> Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile <|nl|> This louring tempest of your home-bred hate; <|nl|> Nor never by advised purpose meet <|nl|> To plot, contrive, or complot any ill <|nl|> 'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> I swear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> And I, to keep all this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:-- <|nl|> By this time, had the king permitted us, <|nl|> One of our souls had wander'd in the air. <|nl|> Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh, <|nl|> As now our flesh is banish'd from this land: <|nl|> Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm; <|nl|> Since thou hast far to go, bear not along <|nl|> The clogging burthen of a guilty soul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> THOMAS MOWBRAY: <|nl|> No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor, <|nl|> My name be blotted from the book of life, <|nl|> And I from heaven banish'd as from hence! <|nl|> But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know; <|nl|> And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue. <|nl|> Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray; <|nl|> Save back to England, all the world's my way. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes <|nl|> I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect <|nl|> Hath from the number of his banish'd years <|nl|> Pluck'd four away. <|nl|> Six frozen winter spent, <|nl|> Return with welcome home from banishment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> How long a time lies in one little word! <|nl|> Four lagging winters and four wanton springs <|nl|> End in a word: such is the breath of kings. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> I thank my liege, that in regard of me <|nl|> He shortens four years of my son's exile: <|nl|> But little vantage shall I reap thereby; <|nl|> For, ere the six years that he hath to spend <|nl|> Can change their moons and bring their times about <|nl|> My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light <|nl|> Shall be extinct with age and endless night; <|nl|> My inch of taper will be burnt and done, <|nl|> And blindfold death not let me see my son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Why uncle, thou hast many years to live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> But not a minute, king, that thou canst give: <|nl|> Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow, <|nl|> And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow; <|nl|> Thou canst help time to furrow me with age, <|nl|> But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage; <|nl|> Thy word is current with him for my death, <|nl|> But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Thy son is banish'd upon good advice, <|nl|> Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave: <|nl|> Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour. <|nl|> You urged me as a judge; but I had rather <|nl|> You would have bid me argue like a father. <|nl|> O, had it been a stranger, not my child, <|nl|> To smooth his fault I should have been more mild: <|nl|> A partial slander sought I to avoid, <|nl|> And in the sentence my own life destroy'd. <|nl|> Alas, I look'd when some of you should say, <|nl|> I was too strict to make mine own away; <|nl|> But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue <|nl|> Against my will to do myself this wrong. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so: <|nl|> Six years we banish him, and he shall go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know, <|nl|> From where you do remain let paper show. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord Marshal: <|nl|> My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride, <|nl|> As far as land will let me, by your side. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words, <|nl|> That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> I have too few to take my leave of you, <|nl|> When the tongue's office should be prodigal <|nl|> To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> Thy grief is but thy absence for a time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Joy absent, grief is present for that time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> What is six winters? they are quickly gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> My heart will sigh when I miscall it so, <|nl|> Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> The sullen passage of thy weary steps <|nl|> Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set <|nl|> The precious jewel of thy home return. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make <|nl|> Will but remember me what a deal of world <|nl|> I wander from the jewels that I love. <|nl|> Must I not serve a long apprenticehood <|nl|> To foreign passages, and in the end, <|nl|> Having my freedom, boast of nothing else <|nl|> But that I was a journeyman to grief? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> All places that the eye of heaven visits <|nl|> Are to a wise man ports and happy havens. <|nl|> Teach thy necessity to reason thus; <|nl|> There is no virtue like necessity. <|nl|> Think not the king did banish thee, <|nl|> But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit, <|nl|> Where it perceives it is but faintly borne. <|nl|> Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour <|nl|> And not the king exiled thee; or suppose <|nl|> Devouring pestilence hangs in our air <|nl|> And thou art flying to a fresher clime: <|nl|> Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it <|nl|> To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest: <|nl|> Suppose the singing birds musicians, <|nl|> The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd, <|nl|> The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more <|nl|> Than a delightful measure or a dance; <|nl|> For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite <|nl|> The man that mocks at it and sets it light. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> O, who can hold a fire in his hand <|nl|> By thinking on the frosty Caucasus? <|nl|> Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite <|nl|> By bare imagination of a feast? <|nl|> Or wallow naked in December snow <|nl|> By thinking on fantastic summer's heat? <|nl|> O, no! the apprehension of the good <|nl|> Gives but the greater feeling to the worse: <|nl|> Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more <|nl|> Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way: <|nl|> Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu; <|nl|> My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet! <|nl|> Where'er I wander, boast of this I can, <|nl|> Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> We did observe. Cousin Aumerle, <|nl|> How far brought you high Hereford on his way? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> I brought high Hereford, if you call him so, <|nl|> But to the next highway, and there I left him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> And say, what store of parting tears were shed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind, <|nl|> Which then blew bitterly against our faces, <|nl|> Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance <|nl|> Did grace our hollow parting with a tear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> What said our cousin when you parted with him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> 'Farewell:' <|nl|> And, for my heart disdained that my tongue <|nl|> Should so profane the word, that taught me craft <|nl|> To counterfeit oppression of such grief <|nl|> That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave. <|nl|> Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours <|nl|> And added years to his short banishment, <|nl|> He should have had a volume of farewells; <|nl|> But since it would not, he had none of me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt, <|nl|> When time shall call him home from banishment, <|nl|> Whether our kinsman come to see his friends. <|nl|> Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green <|nl|> Observed his courtship to the common people; <|nl|> How he did seem to dive into their hearts <|nl|> With humble and familiar courtesy, <|nl|> What reverence he did throw away on slaves, <|nl|> Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles <|nl|> And patient underbearing of his fortune, <|nl|> As 'twere to banish their affects with him. <|nl|> Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench; <|nl|> A brace of draymen bid God speed him well <|nl|> And had the tribute of his supple knee, <|nl|> With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;' <|nl|> As were our England in reversion his, <|nl|> And he our subjects' next degree in hope. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts. <|nl|> Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland, <|nl|> Expedient manage must be made, my liege, <|nl|> Ere further leisure yield them further means <|nl|> For their advantage and your highness' loss. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> We will ourself in person to this war: <|nl|> And, for our coffers, with too great a court <|nl|> And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light, <|nl|> We are inforced to farm our royal realm; <|nl|> The revenue whereof shall furnish us <|nl|> For our affairs in hand: if that come short, <|nl|> Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters; <|nl|> Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich, <|nl|> They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold <|nl|> And send them after to supply our wants; <|nl|> For we will make for Ireland presently. <|nl|> Bushy, what news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord, <|nl|> Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste <|nl|> To entreat your majesty to visit him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Where lies he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> At Ely House. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Now put it, God, in the physician's mind <|nl|> To help him to his grave immediately! <|nl|> The lining of his coffers shall make coats <|nl|> To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars. <|nl|> Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him: <|nl|> Pray God we may make haste, and come too late! <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Amen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> Will the king come, that I may breathe my last <|nl|> In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath; <|nl|> For all in vain comes counsel to his ear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> O, but they say the tongues of dying men <|nl|> Enforce attention like deep harmony: <|nl|> Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain, <|nl|> For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain. <|nl|> He that no more must say is listen'd more <|nl|> Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose; <|nl|> More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before: <|nl|> The setting sun, and music at the close, <|nl|> As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last, <|nl|> Writ in remembrance more than things long past: <|nl|> Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear, <|nl|> My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds, <|nl|> As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond, <|nl|> Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound <|nl|> The open ear of youth doth always listen; <|nl|> Report of fashions in proud Italy, <|nl|> Whose manners still our tardy apish nation <|nl|> Limps after in base imitation. <|nl|> Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity-- <|nl|> So it be new, there's no respect how vile-- <|nl|> That is not quickly buzzed into his ears? <|nl|> Then all too late comes counsel to be heard, <|nl|> Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard. <|nl|> Direct not him whose way himself will choose: <|nl|> 'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> Methinks I am a prophet new inspired <|nl|> And thus expiring do foretell of him: <|nl|> His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last, <|nl|> For violent fires soon burn out themselves; <|nl|> Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short; <|nl|> He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes; <|nl|> With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder: <|nl|> Light vanity, insatiate cormorant, <|nl|> Consuming means, soon preys upon itself. <|nl|> This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, <|nl|> This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, <|nl|> This other Eden, demi-paradise, <|nl|> This fortress built by Nature for herself <|nl|> Against infection and the hand of war, <|nl|> This happy breed of men, this little world, <|nl|> This precious stone set in the silver sea, <|nl|> Which serves it in the office of a wall, <|nl|> Or as a moat defensive to a house, <|nl|> Against the envy of less happier lands, <|nl|> This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, <|nl|> This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, <|nl|> Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth, <|nl|> Renowned for their deeds as far from home, <|nl|> For Christian service and true chivalry, <|nl|> As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry, <|nl|> Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son, <|nl|> This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land, <|nl|> Dear for her reputation through the world, <|nl|> Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it, <|nl|> Like to a tenement or pelting farm: <|nl|> England, bound in with the triumphant sea <|nl|> Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege <|nl|> Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame, <|nl|> With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds: <|nl|> That England, that was wont to conquer others, <|nl|> Hath made a shameful conquest of itself. <|nl|> Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life, <|nl|> How happy then were my ensuing death! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> The king is come: deal mildly with his youth; <|nl|> For young hot colts being raged do rage the more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> O how that name befits my composition! <|nl|> Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old: <|nl|> Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast; <|nl|> And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt? <|nl|> For sleeping England long time have I watch'd; <|nl|> Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt: <|nl|> The pleasure that some fathers feed upon, <|nl|> Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks; <|nl|> And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt: <|nl|> Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave, <|nl|> Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Can sick men play so nicely with their names? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> No, misery makes sport to mock itself: <|nl|> Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me, <|nl|> I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Should dying men flatter with those that live? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> No, no, men living flatter those that die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> Now He that made me knows I see thee ill; <|nl|> Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill. <|nl|> Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land <|nl|> Wherein thou liest in reputation sick; <|nl|> And thou, too careless patient as thou art, <|nl|> Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure <|nl|> Of those physicians that first wounded thee: <|nl|> A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown, <|nl|> Whose compass is no bigger than thy head; <|nl|> And yet, incaged in so small a verge, <|nl|> The waste is no whit lesser than thy land. <|nl|> O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye <|nl|> Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons, <|nl|> From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame, <|nl|> Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd, <|nl|> Which art possess'd now to depose thyself. <|nl|> Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world, <|nl|> It were a shame to let this land by lease; <|nl|> But for thy world enjoying but this land, <|nl|> Is it not more than shame to shame it so? <|nl|> Landlord of England art thou now, not king: <|nl|> Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> A lunatic lean-witted fool, <|nl|> Presuming on an ague's privilege, <|nl|> Darest with thy frozen admonition <|nl|> Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood <|nl|> With fury from his native residence. <|nl|> Now, by my seat's right royal majesty, <|nl|> Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son, <|nl|> This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head <|nl|> Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN OF GAUNT: <|nl|> O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son, <|nl|> For that I was his father Edward's son; <|nl|> That blood already, like the pelican, <|nl|> Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused: <|nl|> My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul, <|nl|> Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls! <|nl|> May be a precedent and witness good <|nl|> That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood: <|nl|> Join with the present sickness that I have; <|nl|> And thy unkindness be like crooked age, <|nl|> To crop at once a too long wither'd flower. <|nl|> Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee! <|nl|> These words hereafter thy tormentors be! <|nl|> Convey me to my bed, then to my grave: <|nl|> Love they to live that love and honour have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> And let them die that age and sullens have; <|nl|> For both hast thou, and both become the grave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> I do beseech your majesty, impute his words <|nl|> To wayward sickliness and age in him: <|nl|> He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear <|nl|> As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his; <|nl|> As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> What says he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Nay, nothing; all is said <|nl|> His tongue is now a stringless instrument; <|nl|> Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Be York the next that must be bankrupt so! <|nl|> Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he; <|nl|> His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be. <|nl|> So much for that. Now for our Irish wars: <|nl|> We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns, <|nl|> Which live like venom where no venom else <|nl|> But only they have privilege to live. <|nl|> And for these great affairs do ask some charge, <|nl|> Towards our assistance we do seize to us <|nl|> The plate, corn, revenues and moveables, <|nl|> Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> How long shall I be patient? ah, how long <|nl|> Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong? <|nl|> Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment <|nl|> Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs, <|nl|> Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke <|nl|> About his marriage, nor my own disgrace, <|nl|> Have ever made me sour my patient cheek, <|nl|> Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face. <|nl|> I am the last of noble Edward's sons, <|nl|> Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first: <|nl|> In war was never lion raged more fierce, <|nl|> In peace was never gentle lamb more mild, <|nl|> Than was that young and princely gentleman. <|nl|> His face thou hast, for even so look'd he, <|nl|> Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours; <|nl|> But when he frown'd, it was against the French <|nl|> And not against his friends; his noble hand <|nl|> Did will what he did spend and spent not that <|nl|> Which his triumphant father's hand had won; <|nl|> His hands were guilty of no kindred blood, <|nl|> But bloody with the enemies of his kin. <|nl|> O Richard! York is too far gone with grief, <|nl|> Or else he never would compare between. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Why, uncle, what's the matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> O my liege, <|nl|> Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased <|nl|> Not to be pardon'd, am content withal. <|nl|> Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands <|nl|> The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford? <|nl|> Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live? <|nl|> Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true? <|nl|> Did not the one deserve to have an heir? <|nl|> Is not his heir a well-deserving son? <|nl|> Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time <|nl|> His charters and his customary rights; <|nl|> Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day; <|nl|> Be not thyself; for how art thou a king <|nl|> But by fair sequence and succession? <|nl|> Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!-- <|nl|> If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights, <|nl|> Call in the letters patent that he hath <|nl|> By his attorneys-general to sue <|nl|> His livery, and deny his offer'd homage, <|nl|> You pluck a thousand dangers on your head, <|nl|> You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts <|nl|> And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts <|nl|> Which honour and allegiance cannot think. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Think what you will, we seize into our hands <|nl|> His plate, his goods, his money and his lands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell: <|nl|> What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell; <|nl|> But by bad courses may be understood <|nl|> That their events can never fall out good. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight: <|nl|> Bid him repair to us to Ely House <|nl|> To see this business. To-morrow next <|nl|> We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow: <|nl|> And we create, in absence of ourself, <|nl|> Our uncle York lord governor of England; <|nl|> For he is just and always loved us well. <|nl|> Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part; <|nl|> Be merry, for our time of stay is short <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> And living too; for now his son is duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD WILLOUGHBY: <|nl|> Barely in title, not in revenue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Richly in both, if justice had her right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> My heart is great; but it must break with silence, <|nl|> Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more <|nl|> That speaks thy words again to do thee harm! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD WILLOUGHBY: <|nl|> Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford? <|nl|> If it be so, out with it boldly, man; <|nl|> Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> No good at all that I can do for him; <|nl|> Unless you call it good to pity him, <|nl|> Bereft and gelded of his patrimony. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne <|nl|> In him, a royal prince, and many moe <|nl|> Of noble blood in this declining land. <|nl|> The king is not himself, but basely led <|nl|> By flatterers; and what they will inform, <|nl|> Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all, <|nl|> That will the king severely prosecute <|nl|> 'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes, <|nl|> And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined <|nl|> For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD WILLOUGHBY: <|nl|> And daily new exactions are devised, <|nl|> As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what: <|nl|> But what, o' God's name, doth become of this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not, <|nl|> But basely yielded upon compromise <|nl|> That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows: <|nl|> More hath he spent in peace than they in wars. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD WILLOUGHBY: <|nl|> The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> He hath not money for these Irish wars, <|nl|> His burthenous taxations notwithstanding, <|nl|> But by the robbing of the banish'd duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> His noble kinsman: most degenerate king! <|nl|> But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing, <|nl|> Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm; <|nl|> We see the wind sit sore upon our sails, <|nl|> And yet we strike not, but securely perish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> We see the very wreck that we must suffer; <|nl|> And unavoided is the danger now, <|nl|> For suffering so the causes of our wreck. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death <|nl|> I spy life peering; but I dare not say <|nl|> How near the tidings of our comfort is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD WILLOUGHBY: <|nl|> Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> Be confident to speak, Northumberland: <|nl|> We three are but thyself; and, speaking so, <|nl|> Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay <|nl|> In Brittany, received intelligence <|nl|> That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham, <|nl|> That late broke from the Duke of Exeter, <|nl|> His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury, <|nl|> Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston, <|nl|> Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint, <|nl|> All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne <|nl|> With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war, <|nl|> Are making hither with all due expedience <|nl|> And shortly mean to touch our northern shore: <|nl|> Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay <|nl|> The first departing of the king for Ireland. <|nl|> If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke, <|nl|> Imp out our drooping country's broken wing, <|nl|> Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown, <|nl|> Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt <|nl|> And make high majesty look like itself, <|nl|> Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh; <|nl|> But if you faint, as fearing to do so, <|nl|> Stay and be secret, and myself will go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD WILLOUGHBY: <|nl|> Hold out my horse, and I will first be there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> Madam, your majesty is too much sad: <|nl|> You promised, when you parted with the king, <|nl|> To lay aside life-harming heaviness <|nl|> And entertain a cheerful disposition. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> To please the king I did; to please myself <|nl|> I cannot do it; yet I know no cause <|nl|> Why I should welcome such a guest as grief, <|nl|> Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest <|nl|> As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks, <|nl|> Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb, <|nl|> Is coming towards me, and my inward soul <|nl|> With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves, <|nl|> More than with parting from my lord the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows, <|nl|> Which shows like grief itself, but is not so; <|nl|> For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears, <|nl|> Divides one thing entire to many objects; <|nl|> Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon <|nl|> Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry <|nl|> Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty, <|nl|> Looking awry upon your lord's departure, <|nl|> Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail; <|nl|> Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows <|nl|> Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen, <|nl|> More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen; <|nl|> Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye, <|nl|> Which for things true weeps things imaginary. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> It may be so; but yet my inward soul <|nl|> Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be, <|nl|> I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad <|nl|> As, though on thinking on no thought I think, <|nl|> Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived <|nl|> From some forefather grief; mine is not so, <|nl|> For nothing had begot my something grief; <|nl|> Or something hath the nothing that I grieve: <|nl|> 'Tis in reversion that I do possess; <|nl|> But what it is, that is not yet known; what <|nl|> I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen: <|nl|> I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is; <|nl|> For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope: <|nl|> Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> That he, our hope, might have retired his power, <|nl|> And driven into despair an enemy's hope, <|nl|> Who strongly hath set footing in this land: <|nl|> The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself, <|nl|> And with uplifted arms is safe arrived <|nl|> At Ravenspurgh. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> Now God in heaven forbid! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse, <|nl|> The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy, <|nl|> The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby, <|nl|> With all their powerful friends, are fled to him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland <|nl|> And all the rest revolted faction traitors? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester <|nl|> Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship, <|nl|> And all the household servants fled with him <|nl|> To Bolingbroke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe, <|nl|> And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir: <|nl|> Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy, <|nl|> And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother, <|nl|> Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> Despair not, madam. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> Who shall hinder me? <|nl|> I will despair, and be at enmity <|nl|> With cozening hope: he is a flatterer, <|nl|> A parasite, a keeper back of death, <|nl|> Who gently would dissolve the bands of life, <|nl|> Which false hope lingers in extremity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> Here comes the Duke of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> With signs of war about his aged neck: <|nl|> O, full of careful business are his looks! <|nl|> Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts: <|nl|> Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth, <|nl|> Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief. <|nl|> Your husband, he is gone to save far off, <|nl|> Whilst others come to make him lose at home: <|nl|> Here am I left to underprop his land, <|nl|> Who, weak with age, cannot support myself: <|nl|> Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made; <|nl|> Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> My lord, your son was gone before I came. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> He was? Why, so! go all which way it will! <|nl|> The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold, <|nl|> And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side. <|nl|> Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester; <|nl|> Bid her send me presently a thousand pound: <|nl|> Hold, take my ring. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship, <|nl|> To-day, as I came by, I called there; <|nl|> But I shall grieve you to report the rest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> What is't, knave? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> An hour before I came, the duchess died. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> God for his mercy! what a tide of woes <|nl|> Comes rushing on this woeful land at once! <|nl|> I know not what to do: I would to God, <|nl|> So my untruth had not provoked him to it, <|nl|> The king had cut off my head with my brother's. <|nl|> What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland? <|nl|> How shall we do for money for these wars? <|nl|> Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me. <|nl|> Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts <|nl|> And bring away the armour that is there. <|nl|> Gentlemen, will you go muster men? <|nl|> If I know how or which way to order these affairs <|nl|> Thus thrust disorderly into my hands, <|nl|> Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen: <|nl|> The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath <|nl|> And duty bids defend; the other again <|nl|> Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd, <|nl|> Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right. <|nl|> Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll <|nl|> Dispose of you. <|nl|> Gentlemen, go, muster up your men, <|nl|> And meet me presently at Berkeley. <|nl|> I should to Plashy too; <|nl|> But time will not permit: all is uneven, <|nl|> And every thing is left at six and seven. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland, <|nl|> But none returns. For us to levy power <|nl|> Proportionable to the enemy <|nl|> Is all unpossible. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> Besides, our nearness to the king in love <|nl|> Is near the hate of those love not the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAGOT: <|nl|> And that's the wavering commons: for their love <|nl|> Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them <|nl|> By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAGOT: <|nl|> If judgement lie in them, then so do we, <|nl|> Because we ever have been near the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle: <|nl|> The Earl of Wiltshire is already there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> Thither will I with you; for little office <|nl|> The hateful commons will perform for us, <|nl|> Except like curs to tear us all to pieces. <|nl|> Will you go along with us? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAGOT: <|nl|> No; I will to Ireland to his majesty. <|nl|> Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain, <|nl|> We three here art that ne'er shall meet again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes <|nl|> Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry: <|nl|> Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly. <|nl|> Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> Well, we may meet again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAGOT: <|nl|> I fear me, never. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Believe me, noble lord, <|nl|> I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire: <|nl|> These high wild hills and rough uneven ways <|nl|> Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome, <|nl|> And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar, <|nl|> Making the hard way sweet and delectable. <|nl|> But I bethink me what a weary way <|nl|> From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found <|nl|> In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company, <|nl|> Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled <|nl|> The tediousness and process of my travel: <|nl|> But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have <|nl|> The present benefit which I possess; <|nl|> And hope to joy is little less in joy <|nl|> Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords <|nl|> Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done <|nl|> By sight of what I have, your noble company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Of much less value is my company <|nl|> Than your good words. But who comes here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> It is my son, young Harry Percy, <|nl|> Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever. <|nl|> Harry, how fares your uncle? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Why, is he not with the queen? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court, <|nl|> Broken his staff of office and dispersed <|nl|> The household of the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> What was his reason? <|nl|> He was not so resolved when last we spake together. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor. <|nl|> But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh, <|nl|> To offer service to the Duke of Hereford, <|nl|> And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover <|nl|> What power the Duke of York had levied there; <|nl|> Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> No, my good lord, for that is not forgot <|nl|> Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge, <|nl|> I never in my life did look on him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Then learn to know him now; this is the duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> My gracious lord, I tender you my service, <|nl|> Such as it is, being tender, raw and young: <|nl|> Which elder days shall ripen and confirm <|nl|> To more approved service and desert. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure <|nl|> I count myself in nothing else so happy <|nl|> As in a soul remembering my good friends; <|nl|> And, as my fortune ripens with thy love, <|nl|> It shall be still thy true love's recompense: <|nl|> My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir <|nl|> Keeps good old York there with his men of war? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees, <|nl|> Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard; <|nl|> And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour; <|nl|> None else of name and noble estimate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby, <|nl|> Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues <|nl|> A banish'd traitor: all my treasury <|nl|> Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd <|nl|> Shall be your love and labour's recompense. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD WILLOUGHBY: <|nl|> And far surmounts our labour to attain it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor; <|nl|> Which, till my infant fortune comes to years, <|nl|> Stands for my bounty. But who comes here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD BERKELEY: <|nl|> My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster; <|nl|> And I am come to seek that name in England; <|nl|> And I must find that title in your tongue, <|nl|> Before I make reply to aught you say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD BERKELEY: <|nl|> Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning <|nl|> To raze one title of your honour out: <|nl|> To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will, <|nl|> From the most gracious regent of this land, <|nl|> The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on <|nl|> To take advantage of the absent time <|nl|> And fright our native peace with self-born arms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> I shall not need transport my words by you; <|nl|> Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee, <|nl|> Whose duty is deceiveable and false. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> My gracious uncle-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Tut, tut! <|nl|> Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle: <|nl|> I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.' <|nl|> In an ungracious mouth is but profane. <|nl|> Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs <|nl|> Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground? <|nl|> But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march <|nl|> So many miles upon her peaceful bosom, <|nl|> Frighting her pale-faced villages with war <|nl|> And ostentation of despised arms? <|nl|> Comest thou because the anointed king is hence? <|nl|> Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind, <|nl|> And in my loyal bosom lies his power. <|nl|> Were I but now the lord of such hot youth <|nl|> As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself <|nl|> Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men, <|nl|> From forth the ranks of many thousand French, <|nl|> O, then how quickly should this arm of mine. <|nl|> Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee <|nl|> And minister correction to thy fault! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> My gracious uncle, let me know my fault: <|nl|> On what condition stands it and wherein? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Even in condition of the worst degree, <|nl|> In gross rebellion and detested treason: <|nl|> Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come <|nl|> Before the expiration of thy time, <|nl|> In braving arms against thy sovereign. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford; <|nl|> But as I come, I come for Lancaster. <|nl|> And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace <|nl|> Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye: <|nl|> You are my father, for methinks in you <|nl|> I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father, <|nl|> Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd <|nl|> A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties <|nl|> Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away <|nl|> To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born? <|nl|> If that my cousin king be King of England, <|nl|> It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster. <|nl|> You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin; <|nl|> Had you first died, and he been thus trod down, <|nl|> He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father, <|nl|> To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay. <|nl|> I am denied to sue my livery here, <|nl|> And yet my letters-patents give me leave: <|nl|> My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold, <|nl|> And these and all are all amiss employ'd. <|nl|> What would you have me do? I am a subject, <|nl|> And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me; <|nl|> And therefore, personally I lay my claim <|nl|> To my inheritance of free descent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> The noble duke hath been too much abused. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD ROSS: <|nl|> It stands your grace upon to do him right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD WILLOUGHBY: <|nl|> Base men by his endowments are made great. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> My lords of England, let me tell you this: <|nl|> I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs <|nl|> And laboured all I could to do him right; <|nl|> But in this kind to come, in braving arms, <|nl|> Be his own carver and cut out his way, <|nl|> To find out right with wrong, it may not be; <|nl|> And you that do abet him in this kind <|nl|> Cherish rebellion and are rebels all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> The noble duke hath sworn his coming is <|nl|> But for his own; and for the right of that <|nl|> We all have strongly sworn to give him aid; <|nl|> And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Well, well, I see the issue of these arms: <|nl|> I cannot mend it, I must needs confess, <|nl|> Because my power is weak and all ill left: <|nl|> But if I could, by Him that gave me life, <|nl|> I would attach you all and make you stoop <|nl|> Unto the sovereign mercy of the king; <|nl|> But since I cannot, be it known to you <|nl|> I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well; <|nl|> Unless you please to enter in the castle <|nl|> And there repose you for this night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> An offer, uncle, that we will accept: <|nl|> But we must win your grace to go with us <|nl|> To Bristol castle, which they say is held <|nl|> By Bushy, Bagot and their complices, <|nl|> The caterpillars of the commonwealth, <|nl|> Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause; <|nl|> For I am loath to break our country's laws. <|nl|> Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are: <|nl|> Things past redress are now with me past care. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Captain: <|nl|> My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days, <|nl|> And hardly kept our countrymen together, <|nl|> And yet we hear no tidings from the king; <|nl|> Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EARL OF SALISBURY: <|nl|> Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman: <|nl|> The king reposeth all his confidence in thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Captain: <|nl|> 'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay. <|nl|> The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd <|nl|> And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven; <|nl|> The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth <|nl|> And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change; <|nl|> Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap, <|nl|> The one in fear to lose what they enjoy, <|nl|> The other to enjoy by rage and war: <|nl|> These signs forerun the death or fall of kings. <|nl|> Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled, <|nl|> As well assured Richard their king is dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EARL OF SALISBURY: <|nl|> Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind <|nl|> I see thy glory like a shooting star <|nl|> Fall to the base earth from the firmament. <|nl|> Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west, <|nl|> Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest: <|nl|> Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes, <|nl|> And crossly to thy good all fortune goes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Bring forth these men. <|nl|> Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls-- <|nl|> Since presently your souls must part your bodies-- <|nl|> With too much urging your pernicious lives, <|nl|> For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood <|nl|> From off my hands, here in the view of men <|nl|> I will unfold some causes of your deaths. <|nl|> You have misled a prince, a royal king, <|nl|> A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments, <|nl|> By you unhappied and disfigured clean: <|nl|> You have in manner with your sinful hours <|nl|> Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him, <|nl|> Broke the possession of a royal bed <|nl|> And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks <|nl|> With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs. <|nl|> Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth, <|nl|> Near to the king in blood, and near in love <|nl|> Till you did make him misinterpret me, <|nl|> Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries, <|nl|> And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds, <|nl|> Eating the bitter bread of banishment; <|nl|> Whilst you have fed upon my signories, <|nl|> Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods, <|nl|> From my own windows torn my household coat, <|nl|> Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign, <|nl|> Save men's opinions and my living blood, <|nl|> To show the world I am a gentleman. <|nl|> This and much more, much more than twice all this, <|nl|> Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over <|nl|> To execution and the hand of death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BUSHY: <|nl|> More welcome is the stroke of death to me <|nl|> Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREEN: <|nl|> My comfort is that heaven will take our souls <|nl|> And plague injustice with the pains of hell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd. <|nl|> Uncle, you say the queen is at your house; <|nl|> For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated: <|nl|> Tell her I send to her my kind commends; <|nl|> Take special care my greetings be deliver'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd <|nl|> With letters of your love to her at large. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away. <|nl|> To fight with Glendower and his complices: <|nl|> Awhile to work, and after holiday. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Barkloughly castle call they this at hand? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air, <|nl|> After your late tossing on the breaking seas? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy <|nl|> To stand upon my kingdom once again. <|nl|> Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand, <|nl|> Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs: <|nl|> As a long-parted mother with her child <|nl|> Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting, <|nl|> So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth, <|nl|> And do thee favours with my royal hands. <|nl|> Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth, <|nl|> Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense; <|nl|> But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom, <|nl|> And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way, <|nl|> Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet <|nl|> Which with usurping steps do trample thee: <|nl|> Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies; <|nl|> And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower, <|nl|> Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder <|nl|> Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch <|nl|> Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies. <|nl|> Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords: <|nl|> This earth shall have a feeling and these stones <|nl|> Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king <|nl|> Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <|nl|> Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king <|nl|> Hath power to keep you king in spite of all. <|nl|> The means that heaven yields must be embraced, <|nl|> And not neglected; else, if heaven would, <|nl|> And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse, <|nl|> The proffer'd means of succor and redress. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> He means, my lord, that we are too remiss; <|nl|> Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security, <|nl|> Grows strong and great in substance and in power. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not <|nl|> That when the searching eye of heaven is hid, <|nl|> Behind the globe, that lights the lower world, <|nl|> Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen <|nl|> In murders and in outrage, boldly here; <|nl|> But when from under this terrestrial ball <|nl|> He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines <|nl|> And darts his light through every guilty hole, <|nl|> Then murders, treasons and detested sins, <|nl|> The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs, <|nl|> Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves? <|nl|> So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke, <|nl|> Who all this while hath revell'd in the night <|nl|> Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes, <|nl|> Shall see us rising in our throne, the east, <|nl|> His treasons will sit blushing in his face, <|nl|> Not able to endure the sight of day, <|nl|> But self-affrighted tremble at his sin. <|nl|> Not all the water in the rough rude sea <|nl|> Can wash the balm off from an anointed king; <|nl|> The breath of worldly men cannot depose <|nl|> The deputy elected by the Lord: <|nl|> For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd <|nl|> To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown, <|nl|> God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay <|nl|> A glorious angel: then, if angels fight, <|nl|> Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right. <|nl|> Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EARL OF SALISBURY: <|nl|> Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord, <|nl|> Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue <|nl|> And bids me speak of nothing but despair. <|nl|> One day too late, I fear me, noble lord, <|nl|> Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth: <|nl|> O, call back yesterday, bid time return, <|nl|> And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men! <|nl|> To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late, <|nl|> O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state: <|nl|> For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead. <|nl|> Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> But now the blood of twenty thousand men <|nl|> Did triumph in my face, and they are fled; <|nl|> And, till so much blood thither come again, <|nl|> Have I not reason to look pale and dead? <|nl|> All souls that will be safe fly from my side, <|nl|> For time hath set a blot upon my pride. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Comfort, my liege; remember who you are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> I had forgot myself; am I not king? <|nl|> Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest. <|nl|> Is not the king's name twenty thousand names? <|nl|> Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes <|nl|> At thy great glory. Look not to the ground, <|nl|> Ye favourites of a king: are we not high? <|nl|> High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York <|nl|> Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <|nl|> More health and happiness betide my liege <|nl|> Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Mine ear is open and my heart prepared; <|nl|> The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold. <|nl|> Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care <|nl|> And what loss is it to be rid of care? <|nl|> Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we? <|nl|> Greater he shall not be; if he serve God, <|nl|> We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so: <|nl|> Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend; <|nl|> They break their faith to God as well as us: <|nl|> Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay: <|nl|> The worst is death, and death will have his day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <|nl|> Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd <|nl|> To bear the tidings of calamity. <|nl|> Like an unseasonable stormy day, <|nl|> Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores, <|nl|> As if the world were all dissolved to tears, <|nl|> So high above his limits swells the rage <|nl|> Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land <|nl|> With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel. <|nl|> White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps <|nl|> Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices, <|nl|> Strive to speak big and clap their female joints <|nl|> In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown: <|nl|> The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows <|nl|> Of double-fatal yew against thy state; <|nl|> Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills <|nl|> Against thy seat: both young and old rebel, <|nl|> And all goes worse than I have power to tell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill. <|nl|> Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot? <|nl|> What is become of Bushy? where is Green? <|nl|> That they have let the dangerous enemy <|nl|> Measure our confines with such peaceful steps? <|nl|> If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it: <|nl|> I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <|nl|> Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption! <|nl|> Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man! <|nl|> Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart! <|nl|> Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas! <|nl|> Would they make peace? terrible hell make war <|nl|> Upon their spotted souls for this offence! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <|nl|> Sweet love, I see, changing his property, <|nl|> Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate: <|nl|> Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made <|nl|> With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse <|nl|> Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound <|nl|> And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <|nl|> Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Where is the duke my father with his power? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> No matter where; of comfort no man speak: <|nl|> Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs; <|nl|> Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes <|nl|> Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth, <|nl|> Let's choose executors and talk of wills: <|nl|> And yet not so, for what can we bequeath <|nl|> Save our deposed bodies to the ground? <|nl|> Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's, <|nl|> And nothing can we call our own but death <|nl|> And that small model of the barren earth <|nl|> Which serves as paste and cover to our bones. <|nl|> For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground <|nl|> And tell sad stories of the death of kings; <|nl|> How some have been deposed; some slain in war, <|nl|> Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed; <|nl|> Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd; <|nl|> All murder'd: for within the hollow crown <|nl|> That rounds the mortal temples of a king <|nl|> Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits, <|nl|> Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp, <|nl|> Allowing him a breath, a little scene, <|nl|> To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks, <|nl|> Infusing him with self and vain conceit, <|nl|> As if this flesh which walls about our life, <|nl|> Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus <|nl|> Comes at the last and with a little pin <|nl|> Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king! <|nl|> Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood <|nl|> With solemn reverence: throw away respect, <|nl|> Tradition, form and ceremonious duty, <|nl|> For you have but mistook me all this while: <|nl|> I live with bread like you, feel want, <|nl|> Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus, <|nl|> How can you say to me, I am a king? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <|nl|> My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes, <|nl|> But presently prevent the ways to wail. <|nl|> To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength, <|nl|> Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe, <|nl|> And so your follies fight against yourself. <|nl|> Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight: <|nl|> And fight and die is death destroying death; <|nl|> Where fearing dying pays death servile breath. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> My father hath a power; inquire of him <|nl|> And learn to make a body of a limb. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come <|nl|> To change blows with thee for our day of doom. <|nl|> This ague fit of fear is over-blown; <|nl|> An easy task it is to win our own. <|nl|> Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power? <|nl|> Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SIR STEPHEN SCROOP: <|nl|> Men judge by the complexion of the sky <|nl|> The state and inclination of the day: <|nl|> So may you by my dull and heavy eye, <|nl|> My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say. <|nl|> I play the torturer, by small and small <|nl|> To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken: <|nl|> Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke, <|nl|> And all your northern castles yielded up, <|nl|> And all your southern gentlemen in arms <|nl|> Upon his party. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Thou hast said enough. <|nl|> Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth <|nl|> Of that sweet way I was in to despair! <|nl|> What say you now? what comfort have we now? <|nl|> By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly <|nl|> That bids me be of comfort any more. <|nl|> Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away; <|nl|> A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey. <|nl|> That power I have, discharge; and let them go <|nl|> To ear the land that hath some hope to grow, <|nl|> For I have none: let no man speak again <|nl|> To alter this, for counsel is but vain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> My liege, one word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> He does me double wrong <|nl|> That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue. <|nl|> Discharge my followers: let them hence away, <|nl|> From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> So that by this intelligence we learn <|nl|> The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury <|nl|> Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed <|nl|> With some few private friends upon this coast. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> The news is very fair and good, my lord: <|nl|> Richard not far from hence hath hid his head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> It would beseem the Lord Northumberland <|nl|> To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day <|nl|> When such a sacred king should hide his head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Your grace mistakes; only to be brief <|nl|> Left I his title out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> The time hath been, <|nl|> Would you have been so brief with him, he would <|nl|> Have been so brief with you, to shorten you, <|nl|> For taking so the head, your whole head's length. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Mistake not, uncle, further than you should. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Take not, good cousin, further than you should. <|nl|> Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself <|nl|> Against their will. But who comes here? <|nl|> Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> The castle royally is mann'd, my lord, <|nl|> Against thy entrance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Royally! <|nl|> Why, it contains no king? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> Yes, my good lord, <|nl|> It doth contain a king; King Richard lies <|nl|> Within the limits of yon lime and stone: <|nl|> And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, <|nl|> Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman <|nl|> Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Noble lords, <|nl|> Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle; <|nl|> Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley <|nl|> Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver: <|nl|> Henry Bolingbroke <|nl|> On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand <|nl|> And sends allegiance and true faith of heart <|nl|> To his most royal person, hither come <|nl|> Even at his feet to lay my arms and power, <|nl|> Provided that my banishment repeal'd <|nl|> And lands restored again be freely granted: <|nl|> If not, I'll use the advantage of my power <|nl|> And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood <|nl|> Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen: <|nl|> The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke <|nl|> It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench <|nl|> The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land, <|nl|> My stooping duty tenderly shall show. <|nl|> Go, signify as much, while here we march <|nl|> Upon the grassy carpet of this plain. <|nl|> Let's march without the noise of threatening drum, <|nl|> That from this castle's tatter'd battlements <|nl|> Our fair appointments may be well perused. <|nl|> Methinks King Richard and myself should meet <|nl|> With no less terror than the elements <|nl|> Of fire and water, when their thundering shock <|nl|> At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven. <|nl|> Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water: <|nl|> The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain <|nl|> My waters; on the earth, and not on him. <|nl|> March on, and mark King Richard how he looks. <|nl|> See, see, King Richard doth himself appear, <|nl|> As doth the blushing discontented sun <|nl|> From out the fiery portal of the east, <|nl|> When he perceives the envious clouds are bent <|nl|> To dim his glory and to stain the track <|nl|> Of his bright passage to the occident. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye, <|nl|> As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth <|nl|> Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe, <|nl|> That any harm should stain so fair a show! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> We are amazed; and thus long have we stood <|nl|> To watch the fearful bending of thy knee, <|nl|> Because we thought ourself thy lawful king: <|nl|> And if we be, how dare thy joints forget <|nl|> To pay their awful duty to our presence? <|nl|> If we be not, show us the hand of God <|nl|> That hath dismissed us from our stewardship; <|nl|> For well we know, no hand of blood and bone <|nl|> Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre, <|nl|> Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp. <|nl|> And though you think that all, as you have done, <|nl|> Have torn their souls by turning them from us, <|nl|> And we are barren and bereft of friends; <|nl|> Yet know, my master, God omnipotent, <|nl|> Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf <|nl|> Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike <|nl|> Your children yet unborn and unbegot, <|nl|> That lift your vassal hands against my head <|nl|> And threat the glory of my precious crown. <|nl|> Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands-- <|nl|> That every stride he makes upon my land <|nl|> Is dangerous treason: he is come to open <|nl|> The purple testament of bleeding war; <|nl|> But ere the crown he looks for live in peace, <|nl|> Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons <|nl|> Shall ill become the flower of England's face, <|nl|> Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace <|nl|> To scarlet indignation and bedew <|nl|> Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> The king of heaven forbid our lord the king <|nl|> Should so with civil and uncivil arms <|nl|> Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin <|nl|> Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand; <|nl|> And by the honourable tomb he swears, <|nl|> That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones, <|nl|> And by the royalties of both your bloods, <|nl|> Currents that spring from one most gracious head, <|nl|> And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt, <|nl|> And by the worth and honour of himself, <|nl|> Comprising all that may be sworn or said, <|nl|> His coming hither hath no further scope <|nl|> Than for his lineal royalties and to beg <|nl|> Enfranchisement immediate on his knees: <|nl|> Which on thy royal party granted once, <|nl|> His glittering arms he will commend to rust, <|nl|> His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart <|nl|> To faithful service of your majesty. <|nl|> This swears he, as he is a prince, is just; <|nl|> And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Northumberland, say thus the king returns: <|nl|> His noble cousin is right welcome hither; <|nl|> And all the number of his fair demands <|nl|> Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction: <|nl|> With all the gracious utterance thou hast <|nl|> Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends. <|nl|> We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not, <|nl|> To look so poorly and to speak so fair? <|nl|> Shall we call back Northumberland, and send <|nl|> Defiance to the traitor, and so die? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words <|nl|> Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine, <|nl|> That laid the sentence of dread banishment <|nl|> On yon proud man, should take it off again <|nl|> With words of sooth! O that I were as great <|nl|> As is my grief, or lesser than my name! <|nl|> Or that I could forget what I have been, <|nl|> Or not remember what I must be now! <|nl|> Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat, <|nl|> Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> What must the king do now? must he submit? <|nl|> The king shall do it: must he be deposed? <|nl|> The king shall be contented: must he lose <|nl|> The name of king? o' God's name, let it go: <|nl|> I'll give my jewels for a set of beads, <|nl|> My gorgeous palace for a hermitage, <|nl|> My gay apparel for an almsman's gown, <|nl|> My figured goblets for a dish of wood, <|nl|> My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff, <|nl|> My subjects for a pair of carved saints <|nl|> And my large kingdom for a little grave, <|nl|> A little little grave, an obscure grave; <|nl|> Or I'll be buried in the king's highway, <|nl|> Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet <|nl|> May hourly trample on their sovereign's head; <|nl|> For on my heart they tread now whilst I live; <|nl|> And buried once, why not upon my head? <|nl|> Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin! <|nl|> We'll make foul weather with despised tears; <|nl|> Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn, <|nl|> And make a dearth in this revolting land. <|nl|> Or shall we play the wantons with our woes, <|nl|> And make some pretty match with shedding tears? <|nl|> As thus, to drop them still upon one place, <|nl|> Till they have fretted us a pair of graves <|nl|> Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies <|nl|> Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes. <|nl|> Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see <|nl|> I talk but idly, and you laugh at me. <|nl|> Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland, <|nl|> What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty <|nl|> Give Richard leave to live till Richard die? <|nl|> You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> My lord, in the base court he doth attend <|nl|> To speak with you; may it please you to come down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon, <|nl|> Wanting the manage of unruly jades. <|nl|> In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base, <|nl|> To come at traitors' calls and do them grace. <|nl|> In the base court? Come down? Down, court! <|nl|> down, king! <|nl|> For night-owls shriek where mounting larks <|nl|> should sing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> What says his majesty? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Sorrow and grief of heart <|nl|> Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man <|nl|> Yet he is come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Stand all apart, <|nl|> And show fair duty to his majesty. <|nl|> My gracious lord,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee <|nl|> To make the base earth proud with kissing it: <|nl|> Me rather had my heart might feel your love <|nl|> Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy. <|nl|> Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know, <|nl|> Thus high at least, although your knee be low. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> My gracious lord, I come but for mine own. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> So far be mine, my most redoubted lord, <|nl|> As my true service shall deserve your love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Well you deserve: they well deserve to have, <|nl|> That know the strong'st and surest way to get. <|nl|> Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes; <|nl|> Tears show their love, but want their remedies. <|nl|> Cousin, I am too young to be your father, <|nl|> Though you are old enough to be my heir. <|nl|> What you will have, I'll give, and willing too; <|nl|> For do we must what force will have us do. <|nl|> Set on towards London, cousin, is it so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Yea, my good lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Then I must not say no. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> What sport shall we devise here in this garden, <|nl|> To drive away the heavy thought of care? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lady: <|nl|> Madam, we'll play at bowls. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs, <|nl|> And that my fortune rubs against the bias. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lady: <|nl|> Madam, we'll dance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> My legs can keep no measure in delight, <|nl|> When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief: <|nl|> Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lady: <|nl|> Madam, we'll tell tales. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> Of sorrow or of joy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lady: <|nl|> Of either, madam. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> Of neither, girl: <|nl|> For of joy, being altogether wanting, <|nl|> It doth remember me the more of sorrow; <|nl|> Or if of grief, being altogether had, <|nl|> It adds more sorrow to my want of joy: <|nl|> For what I have I need not to repeat; <|nl|> And what I want it boots not to complain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lady: <|nl|> Madam, I'll sing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> 'Tis well that thou hast cause <|nl|> But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lady: <|nl|> I could weep, madam, would it do you good. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> And I could sing, would weeping do me good, <|nl|> And never borrow any tear of thee. <|nl|> But stay, here come the gardeners: <|nl|> Let's step into the shadow of these trees. <|nl|> My wretchedness unto a row of pins, <|nl|> They'll talk of state; for every one doth so <|nl|> Against a change; woe is forerun with woe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gardener: <|nl|> Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks, <|nl|> Which, like unruly children, make their sire <|nl|> Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight: <|nl|> Give some supportance to the bending twigs. <|nl|> Go thou, and like an executioner, <|nl|> Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays, <|nl|> That look too lofty in our commonwealth: <|nl|> All must be even in our government. <|nl|> You thus employ'd, I will go root away <|nl|> The noisome weeds, which without profit suck <|nl|> The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Why should we in the compass of a pale <|nl|> Keep law and form and due proportion, <|nl|> Showing, as in a model, our firm estate, <|nl|> When our sea-walled garden, the whole land, <|nl|> Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up, <|nl|> Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd, <|nl|> Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs <|nl|> Swarming with caterpillars? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gardener: <|nl|> Hold thy peace: <|nl|> He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring <|nl|> Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf: <|nl|> The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter, <|nl|> That seem'd in eating him to hold him up, <|nl|> Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke, <|nl|> I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> What, are they dead? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gardener: <|nl|> They are; and Bolingbroke <|nl|> Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it <|nl|> That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land <|nl|> As we this garden! We at time of year <|nl|> Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees, <|nl|> Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood, <|nl|> With too much riches it confound itself: <|nl|> Had he done so to great and growing men, <|nl|> They might have lived to bear and he to taste <|nl|> Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches <|nl|> We lop away, that bearing boughs may live: <|nl|> Had he done so, himself had borne the crown, <|nl|> Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> What, think you then the king shall be deposed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gardener: <|nl|> Depress'd he is already, and deposed <|nl|> 'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night <|nl|> To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's, <|nl|> That tell black tidings. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking! <|nl|> Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden, <|nl|> How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news? <|nl|> What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee <|nl|> To make a second fall of cursed man? <|nl|> Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed? <|nl|> Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth, <|nl|> Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how, <|nl|> Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gardener: <|nl|> Pardon me, madam: little joy have I <|nl|> To breathe this news; yet what I say is true. <|nl|> King Richard, he is in the mighty hold <|nl|> Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd: <|nl|> In your lord's scale is nothing but himself, <|nl|> And some few vanities that make him light; <|nl|> But in the balance of great Bolingbroke, <|nl|> Besides himself, are all the English peers, <|nl|> And with that odds he weighs King Richard down. <|nl|> Post you to London, and you will find it so; <|nl|> I speak no more than every one doth know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot, <|nl|> Doth not thy embassage belong to me, <|nl|> And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st <|nl|> To serve me last, that I may longest keep <|nl|> Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go, <|nl|> To meet at London London's king in woe. <|nl|> What, was I born to this, that my sad look <|nl|> Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke? <|nl|> Gardener, for telling me these news of woe, <|nl|> Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GARDENER: <|nl|> Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse, <|nl|> I would my skill were subject to thy curse. <|nl|> Here did she fall a tear; here in this place <|nl|> I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace: <|nl|> Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen, <|nl|> In the remembrance of a weeping queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Call forth Bagot. <|nl|> Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind; <|nl|> What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death, <|nl|> Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd <|nl|> The bloody office of his timeless end. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAGOT: <|nl|> Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAGOT: <|nl|> My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue <|nl|> Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd. <|nl|> In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted, <|nl|> I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length, <|nl|> That reacheth from the restful English court <|nl|> As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?' <|nl|> Amongst much other talk, that very time, <|nl|> I heard you say that you had rather refuse <|nl|> The offer of an hundred thousand crowns <|nl|> Than Bolingbroke's return to England; <|nl|> Adding withal how blest this land would be <|nl|> In this your cousin's death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Princes and noble lords, <|nl|> What answer shall I make to this base man? <|nl|> Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars, <|nl|> On equal terms to give him chastisement? <|nl|> Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd <|nl|> With the attainder of his slanderous lips. <|nl|> There is my gage, the manual seal of death, <|nl|> That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest, <|nl|> And will maintain what thou hast said is false <|nl|> In thy heart-blood, though being all too base <|nl|> To stain the temper of my knightly sword. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Excepting one, I would he were the best <|nl|> In all this presence that hath moved me so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD FITZWATER: <|nl|> If that thy valour stand on sympathy, <|nl|> There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine: <|nl|> By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st, <|nl|> I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it <|nl|> That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death. <|nl|> If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest; <|nl|> And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart, <|nl|> Where it was forged, with my rapier's point. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD FITZWATER: <|nl|> Now by my soul, I would it were this hour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true <|nl|> In this appeal as thou art all unjust; <|nl|> And that thou art so, there I throw my gage, <|nl|> To prove it on thee to the extremest point <|nl|> Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> An if I do not, may my hands rot off <|nl|> And never brandish more revengeful steel <|nl|> Over the glittering helmet of my foe! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle; <|nl|> And spur thee on with full as many lies <|nl|> As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear <|nl|> From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn; <|nl|> Engage it to the trial, if thou darest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all: <|nl|> I have a thousand spirits in one breast, <|nl|> To answer twenty thousand such as you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF SURREY: <|nl|> My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well <|nl|> The very time Aumerle and you did talk. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD FITZWATER: <|nl|> 'Tis very true: you were in presence then; <|nl|> And you can witness with me this is true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF SURREY: <|nl|> As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD FITZWATER: <|nl|> Surrey, thou liest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF SURREY: <|nl|> Dishonourable boy! <|nl|> That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword, <|nl|> That it shall render vengeance and revenge <|nl|> Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie <|nl|> In earth as quiet as thy father's skull: <|nl|> In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn; <|nl|> Engage it to the trial, if thou darest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD FITZWATER: <|nl|> How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse! <|nl|> If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live, <|nl|> I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness, <|nl|> And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies, <|nl|> And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith, <|nl|> To tie thee to my strong correction. <|nl|> As I intend to thrive in this new world, <|nl|> Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal: <|nl|> Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say <|nl|> That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men <|nl|> To execute the noble duke at Calais. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Some honest Christian trust me with a gage <|nl|> That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this, <|nl|> If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> These differences shall all rest under gage <|nl|> Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be, <|nl|> And, though mine enemy, restored again <|nl|> To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd, <|nl|> Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <|nl|> That honourable day shall ne'er be seen. <|nl|> Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought <|nl|> For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field, <|nl|> Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross <|nl|> Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens: <|nl|> And toil'd with works of war, retired himself <|nl|> To Italy; and there at Venice gave <|nl|> His body to that pleasant country's earth, <|nl|> And his pure soul unto his captain Christ, <|nl|> Under whose colours he had fought so long. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <|nl|> As surely as I live, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom <|nl|> Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants, <|nl|> Your differences shall all rest under gage <|nl|> Till we assign you to your days of trial. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee <|nl|> From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul <|nl|> Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields <|nl|> To the possession of thy royal hand: <|nl|> Ascend his throne, descending now from him; <|nl|> And long live Henry, fourth of that name! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <|nl|> Marry. God forbid! <|nl|> Worst in this royal presence may I speak, <|nl|> Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth. <|nl|> Would God that any in this noble presence <|nl|> Were enough noble to be upright judge <|nl|> Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would <|nl|> Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong. <|nl|> What subject can give sentence on his king? <|nl|> And who sits here that is not Richard's subject? <|nl|> Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear, <|nl|> Although apparent guilt be seen in them; <|nl|> And shall the figure of God's majesty, <|nl|> His captain, steward, deputy-elect, <|nl|> Anointed, crowned, planted many years, <|nl|> Be judged by subject and inferior breath, <|nl|> And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God, <|nl|> That in a Christian climate souls refined <|nl|> Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed! <|nl|> I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks, <|nl|> Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king: <|nl|> My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king, <|nl|> Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king: <|nl|> And if you crown him, let me prophesy: <|nl|> The blood of English shall manure the ground, <|nl|> And future ages groan for this foul act; <|nl|> Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels, <|nl|> And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars <|nl|> Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound; <|nl|> Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny <|nl|> Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd <|nl|> The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls. <|nl|> O, if you raise this house against this house, <|nl|> It will the woefullest division prove <|nl|> That ever fell upon this cursed earth. <|nl|> Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so, <|nl|> Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe! <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains, <|nl|> Of capital treason we arrest you here. <|nl|> My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge <|nl|> To keep him safely till his day of trial. <|nl|> May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Fetch hither Richard, that in common view <|nl|> He may surrender; so we shall proceed <|nl|> Without suspicion. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> I will be his conduct. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Lords, you that here are under our arrest, <|nl|> Procure your sureties for your days of answer. <|nl|> Little are we beholding to your love, <|nl|> And little look'd for at your helping hands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Alack, why am I sent for to a king, <|nl|> Before I have shook off the regal thoughts <|nl|> Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd <|nl|> To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs: <|nl|> Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me <|nl|> To this submission. Yet I well remember <|nl|> The favours of these men: were they not mine? <|nl|> Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me? <|nl|> So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve, <|nl|> Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none. <|nl|> God save the king! Will no man say amen? <|nl|> Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen. <|nl|> God save the king! although I be not he; <|nl|> And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me. <|nl|> To do what service am I sent for hither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> To do that office of thine own good will <|nl|> Which tired majesty did make thee offer, <|nl|> The resignation of thy state and crown <|nl|> To Henry Bolingbroke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown; <|nl|> Here cousin: <|nl|> On this side my hand, and on that side yours. <|nl|> Now is this golden crown like a deep well <|nl|> That owes two buckets, filling one another, <|nl|> The emptier ever dancing in the air, <|nl|> The other down, unseen and full of water: <|nl|> That bucket down and full of tears am I, <|nl|> Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> I thought you had been willing to resign. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine: <|nl|> You may my glories and my state depose, <|nl|> But not my griefs; still am I king of those. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Part of your cares you give me with your crown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down. <|nl|> My care is loss of care, by old care done; <|nl|> Your care is gain of care, by new care won: <|nl|> The cares I give I have, though given away; <|nl|> They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Are you contented to resign the crown? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be; <|nl|> Therefore no no, for I resign to thee. <|nl|> Now mark me, how I will undo myself; <|nl|> I give this heavy weight from off my head <|nl|> And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand, <|nl|> The pride of kingly sway from out my heart; <|nl|> With mine own tears I wash away my balm, <|nl|> With mine own hands I give away my crown, <|nl|> With mine own tongue deny my sacred state, <|nl|> With mine own breath release all duty's rites: <|nl|> All pomp and majesty I do forswear; <|nl|> My manors, rents, revenues I forego; <|nl|> My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny: <|nl|> God pardon all oaths that are broke to me! <|nl|> God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee! <|nl|> Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved, <|nl|> And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved! <|nl|> Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit, <|nl|> And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit! <|nl|> God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says, <|nl|> And send him many years of sunshine days! <|nl|> What more remains? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> No more, but that you read <|nl|> These accusations and these grievous crimes <|nl|> Committed by your person and your followers <|nl|> Against the state and profit of this land; <|nl|> That, by confessing them, the souls of men <|nl|> May deem that you are worthily deposed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Must I do so? and must I ravel out <|nl|> My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland, <|nl|> If thy offences were upon record, <|nl|> Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop <|nl|> To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst, <|nl|> There shouldst thou find one heinous article, <|nl|> Containing the deposing of a king <|nl|> And cracking the strong warrant of an oath, <|nl|> Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven: <|nl|> Nay, all of you that stand and look upon, <|nl|> Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself, <|nl|> Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands <|nl|> Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates <|nl|> Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross, <|nl|> And water cannot wash away your sin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see: <|nl|> And yet salt water blinds them not so much <|nl|> But they can see a sort of traitors here. <|nl|> Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself, <|nl|> I find myself a traitor with the rest; <|nl|> For I have given here my soul's consent <|nl|> To undeck the pompous body of a king; <|nl|> Made glory base and sovereignty a slave, <|nl|> Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> My lord,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man, <|nl|> Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title, <|nl|> No, not that name was given me at the font, <|nl|> But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day, <|nl|> That I have worn so many winters out, <|nl|> And know not now what name to call myself! <|nl|> O that I were a mockery king of snow, <|nl|> Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke, <|nl|> To melt myself away in water-drops! <|nl|> Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good, <|nl|> An if my word be sterling yet in England, <|nl|> Let it command a mirror hither straight, <|nl|> That it may show me what a face I have, <|nl|> Since it is bankrupt of his majesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> The commons will not then be satisfied. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough, <|nl|> When I do see the very book indeed <|nl|> Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself. <|nl|> Give me the glass, and therein will I read. <|nl|> No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck <|nl|> So many blows upon this face of mine, <|nl|> And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass, <|nl|> Like to my followers in prosperity, <|nl|> Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face <|nl|> That every day under his household roof <|nl|> Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face <|nl|> That, like the sun, did make beholders wink? <|nl|> Was this the face that faced so many follies, <|nl|> And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke? <|nl|> A brittle glory shineth in this face: <|nl|> As brittle as the glory is the face; <|nl|> For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers. <|nl|> Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport, <|nl|> How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd <|nl|> The shadow or your face. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Say that again. <|nl|> The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see: <|nl|> 'Tis very true, my grief lies all within; <|nl|> And these external manners of laments <|nl|> Are merely shadows to the unseen grief <|nl|> That swells with silence in the tortured soul; <|nl|> There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king, <|nl|> For thy great bounty, that not only givest <|nl|> Me cause to wail but teachest me the way <|nl|> How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon, <|nl|> And then be gone and trouble you no more. <|nl|> Shall I obtain it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Name it, fair cousin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> 'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king: <|nl|> For when I was a king, my flatterers <|nl|> Were then but subjects; being now a subject, <|nl|> I have a king here to my flatterer. <|nl|> Being so great, I have no need to beg. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Yet ask. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> And shall I have? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> You shall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Then give me leave to go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Whither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Whither you will, so I were from your sights. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Go, some of you convey him to the Tower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> O, good! convey? conveyers are you all, <|nl|> That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> On Wednesday next we solemnly set down <|nl|> Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Abbot: <|nl|> A woeful pageant have we here beheld. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BISHOP OF CARLISLE: <|nl|> The woe's to come; the children yet unborn. <|nl|> Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> You holy clergymen, is there no plot <|nl|> To rid the realm of this pernicious blot? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Abbot: <|nl|> My lord, <|nl|> Before I freely speak my mind herein, <|nl|> You shall not only take the sacrament <|nl|> To bury mine intents, but also to effect <|nl|> Whatever I shall happen to devise. <|nl|> I see your brows are full of discontent, <|nl|> Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears: <|nl|> Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay <|nl|> A plot shall show us all a merry day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> This way the king will come; this is the way <|nl|> To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower, <|nl|> To whose flint bosom my condemned lord <|nl|> Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke: <|nl|> Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth <|nl|> Have any resting for her true king's queen. <|nl|> But soft, but see, or rather do not see, <|nl|> My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold, <|nl|> That you in pity may dissolve to dew, <|nl|> And wash him fresh again with true-love tears. <|nl|> Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand, <|nl|> Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb, <|nl|> And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn, <|nl|> Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee, <|nl|> When triumph is become an alehouse guest? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so, <|nl|> To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul, <|nl|> To think our former state a happy dream; <|nl|> From which awaked, the truth of what we are <|nl|> Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet, <|nl|> To grim Necessity, and he and I <|nl|> Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France <|nl|> And cloister thee in some religious house: <|nl|> Our holy lives must win a new world's crown, <|nl|> Which our profane hours here have stricken down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> What, is my Richard both in shape and mind <|nl|> Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed <|nl|> Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart? <|nl|> The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw, <|nl|> And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage <|nl|> To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like, <|nl|> Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod, <|nl|> And fawn on rage with base humility, <|nl|> Which art a lion and a king of beasts? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts, <|nl|> I had been still a happy king of men. <|nl|> Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France: <|nl|> Think I am dead and that even here thou takest, <|nl|> As from my death-bed, thy last living leave. <|nl|> In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire <|nl|> With good old folks and let them tell thee tales <|nl|> Of woeful ages long ago betid; <|nl|> And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs, <|nl|> Tell thou the lamentable tale of me <|nl|> And send the hearers weeping to their beds: <|nl|> For why, the senseless brands will sympathize <|nl|> The heavy accent of thy moving tongue <|nl|> And in compassion weep the fire out; <|nl|> And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black, <|nl|> For the deposing of a rightful king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed: <|nl|> You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower. <|nl|> And, madam, there is order ta'en for you; <|nl|> With all swift speed you must away to France. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal <|nl|> The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne, <|nl|> The time shall not be many hours of age <|nl|> More than it is ere foul sin gathering head <|nl|> Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think, <|nl|> Though he divide the realm and give thee half, <|nl|> It is too little, helping him to all; <|nl|> And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way <|nl|> To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again, <|nl|> Being ne'er so little urged, another way <|nl|> To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne. <|nl|> The love of wicked men converts to fear; <|nl|> That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both <|nl|> To worthy danger and deserved death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> My guilt be on my head, and there an end. <|nl|> Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate <|nl|> A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me, <|nl|> And then betwixt me and my married wife. <|nl|> Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me; <|nl|> And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made. <|nl|> Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north, <|nl|> Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime; <|nl|> My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp, <|nl|> She came adorned hither like sweet May, <|nl|> Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> And must we be divided? must we part? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> Banish us both and send the king with me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> That were some love but little policy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> Then whither he goes, thither let me go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> So two, together weeping, make one woe. <|nl|> Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here; <|nl|> Better far off than near, be ne'er the near. <|nl|> Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> So longest way shall have the longest moans. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short, <|nl|> And piece the way out with a heavy heart. <|nl|> Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief, <|nl|> Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief; <|nl|> One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part; <|nl|> Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN: <|nl|> Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part <|nl|> To take on me to keep and kill thy heart. <|nl|> So, now I have mine own again, be gone, <|nl|> That I might strive to kill it with a groan. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> We make woe wanton with this fond delay: <|nl|> Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> My lord, you told me you would tell the rest, <|nl|> When weeping made you break the story off, <|nl|> of our two cousins coming into London. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Where did I leave? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> At that sad stop, my lord, <|nl|> Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops <|nl|> Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke, <|nl|> Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed <|nl|> Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know, <|nl|> With slow but stately pace kept on his course, <|nl|> Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee, <|nl|> Bolingbroke!' <|nl|> You would have thought the very windows spake, <|nl|> So many greedy looks of young and old <|nl|> Through casements darted their desiring eyes <|nl|> Upon his visage, and that all the walls <|nl|> With painted imagery had said at once <|nl|> 'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!' <|nl|> Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning, <|nl|> Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck, <|nl|> Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:' <|nl|> And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> As in a theatre, the eyes of men, <|nl|> After a well-graced actor leaves the stage, <|nl|> Are idly bent on him that enters next, <|nl|> Thinking his prattle to be tedious; <|nl|> Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes <|nl|> Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!' <|nl|> No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home: <|nl|> But dust was thrown upon his sacred head: <|nl|> Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off, <|nl|> His face still combating with tears and smiles, <|nl|> The badges of his grief and patience, <|nl|> That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd <|nl|> The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted <|nl|> And barbarism itself have pitied him. <|nl|> But heaven hath a hand in these events, <|nl|> To whose high will we bound our calm contents. <|nl|> To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now, <|nl|> Whose state and honour I for aye allow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Here comes my son Aumerle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Aumerle that was; <|nl|> But that is lost for being Richard's friend, <|nl|> And, madam, you must call him Rutland now: <|nl|> I am in parliament pledge for his truth <|nl|> And lasting fealty to the new-made king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Welcome, my son: who are the violets now <|nl|> That strew the green lap of the new come spring? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not: <|nl|> God knows I had as lief be none as one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Well, bear you well in this new spring of time, <|nl|> Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime. <|nl|> What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> For aught I know, my lord, they do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> You will be there, I know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> If God prevent not, I purpose so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom? <|nl|> Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> My lord, 'tis nothing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> No matter, then, who see it; <|nl|> I will be satisfied; let me see the writing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> I do beseech your grace to pardon me: <|nl|> It is a matter of small consequence, <|nl|> Which for some reasons I would not have seen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see. <|nl|> I fear, I fear,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> What should you fear? <|nl|> 'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into <|nl|> For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond <|nl|> That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool. <|nl|> Boy, let me see the writing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say. <|nl|> Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> What is the matter, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Ho! who is within there? <|nl|> Saddle my horse. <|nl|> God for his mercy, what treachery is here! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Why, what is it, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse. <|nl|> Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth, <|nl|> I will appeach the villain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> What is the matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Peace, foolish woman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Good mother, be content; it is no more <|nl|> Than my poor life must answer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Thy life answer! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Bring me my boots: I will unto the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed. <|nl|> Hence, villain! never more come in my sight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Give me my boots, I say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Why, York, what wilt thou do? <|nl|> Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own? <|nl|> Have we more sons? or are we like to have? <|nl|> Is not my teeming date drunk up with time? <|nl|> And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age, <|nl|> And rob me of a happy mother's name? <|nl|> Is he not like thee? is he not thine own? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Thou fond mad woman, <|nl|> Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy? <|nl|> A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament, <|nl|> And interchangeably set down their hands, <|nl|> To kill the king at Oxford. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> He shall be none; <|nl|> We'll keep him here: then what is that to him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son, <|nl|> I would appeach him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Hadst thou groan'd for him <|nl|> As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful. <|nl|> But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect <|nl|> That I have been disloyal to thy bed, <|nl|> And that he is a bastard, not thy son: <|nl|> Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind: <|nl|> He is as like thee as a man may be, <|nl|> Not like to me, or any of my kin, <|nl|> And yet I love him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Make way, unruly woman! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse; <|nl|> Spur post, and get before him to the king, <|nl|> And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee. <|nl|> I'll not be long behind; though I be old, <|nl|> I doubt not but to ride as fast as York: <|nl|> And never will I rise up from the ground <|nl|> Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son? <|nl|> 'Tis full three months since I did see him last; <|nl|> If any plague hang over us, 'tis he. <|nl|> I would to God, my lords, he might be found: <|nl|> Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there, <|nl|> For there, they say, he daily doth frequent, <|nl|> With unrestrained loose companions, <|nl|> Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes, <|nl|> And beat our watch, and rob our passengers; <|nl|> Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy, <|nl|> Takes on the point of honour to support <|nl|> So dissolute a crew. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> My lord, some two days since I saw the prince, <|nl|> And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> And what said the gallant? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> His answer was, he would unto the stews, <|nl|> And from the common'st creature pluck a glove, <|nl|> And wear it as a favour; and with that <|nl|> He would unhorse the lustiest challenger. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> As dissolute as desperate; yet through both <|nl|> I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years <|nl|> May happily bring forth. But who comes here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Where is the king? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> What means our cousin, that he stares and looks <|nl|> So wildly? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty, <|nl|> To have some conference with your grace alone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone. <|nl|> What is the matter with our cousin now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> For ever may my knees grow to the earth, <|nl|> My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth <|nl|> Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Intended or committed was this fault? <|nl|> If on the first, how heinous e'er it be, <|nl|> To win thy after-love I pardon thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Then give me leave that I may turn the key, <|nl|> That no man enter till my tale be done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Have thy desire. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Villain, I'll make thee safe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> What is the matter, uncle? speak; <|nl|> Recover breath; tell us how near is danger, <|nl|> That we may arm us to encounter it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know <|nl|> The treason that my haste forbids me show. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd: <|nl|> I do repent me; read not my name there <|nl|> My heart is not confederate with my hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down. <|nl|> I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king; <|nl|> Fear, and not love, begets his penitence: <|nl|> Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove <|nl|> A serpent that will sting thee to the heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy! <|nl|> O loyal father of a treacherous son! <|nl|> Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain, <|nl|> From when this stream through muddy passages <|nl|> Hath held his current and defiled himself! <|nl|> Thy overflow of good converts to bad, <|nl|> And thy abundant goodness shall excuse <|nl|> This deadly blot in thy digressing son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd; <|nl|> And he shall spend mine honour with his shame, <|nl|> As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold. <|nl|> Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies, <|nl|> Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies: <|nl|> Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath, <|nl|> The traitor lives, the true man's put to death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I. <|nl|> Speak with me, pity me, open the door. <|nl|> A beggar begs that never begg'd before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing, <|nl|> And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.' <|nl|> My dangerous cousin, let your mother in: <|nl|> I know she is come to pray for your foul sin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> If thou do pardon, whosoever pray, <|nl|> More sins for this forgiveness prosper may. <|nl|> This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound; <|nl|> This let alone will all the rest confound. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> O king, believe not this hard-hearted man! <|nl|> Love loving not itself none other can. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here? <|nl|> Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Rise up, good aunt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Not yet, I thee beseech: <|nl|> For ever will I walk upon my knees, <|nl|> And never see day that the happy sees, <|nl|> Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy, <|nl|> By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF AUMERLE: <|nl|> Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Against them both my true joints bended be. <|nl|> Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face; <|nl|> His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest; <|nl|> His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast: <|nl|> He prays but faintly and would be denied; <|nl|> We pray with heart and soul and all beside: <|nl|> His weary joints would gladly rise, I know; <|nl|> Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow: <|nl|> His prayers are full of false hypocrisy; <|nl|> Ours of true zeal and deep integrity. <|nl|> Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have <|nl|> That mercy which true prayer ought to have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Good aunt, stand up. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Nay, do not say, 'stand up;' <|nl|> Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.' <|nl|> And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach, <|nl|> 'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech. <|nl|> I never long'd to hear a word till now; <|nl|> Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how: <|nl|> The word is short, but not so short as sweet; <|nl|> No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE OF YORK: <|nl|> Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy? <|nl|> Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord, <|nl|> That set'st the word itself against the word! <|nl|> Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land; <|nl|> The chopping French we do not understand. <|nl|> Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there; <|nl|> Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear; <|nl|> That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce, <|nl|> Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Good aunt, stand up. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> I do not sue to stand; <|nl|> Pardon is all the suit I have in hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> I pardon him, as God shall pardon me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> O happy vantage of a kneeling knee! <|nl|> Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again; <|nl|> Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain, <|nl|> But makes one pardon strong. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> With all my heart <|nl|> I pardon him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> A god on earth thou art. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot, <|nl|> With all the rest of that consorted crew, <|nl|> Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels. <|nl|> Good uncle, help to order several powers <|nl|> To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are: <|nl|> They shall not live within this world, I swear, <|nl|> But I will have them, if I once know where. <|nl|> Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu: <|nl|> Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUCHESS OF YORK: <|nl|> Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXTON: <|nl|> Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake, <|nl|> 'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?' <|nl|> Was it not so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> These were his very words. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXTON: <|nl|> 'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice, <|nl|> And urged it twice together, did he not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> He did. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXTON: <|nl|> And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me, <|nl|> And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man' <|nl|> That would divorce this terror from my heart;' <|nl|> Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go: <|nl|> I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> I have been studying how I may compare <|nl|> This prison where I live unto the world: <|nl|> And for because the world is populous <|nl|> And here is not a creature but myself, <|nl|> I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out. <|nl|> My brain I'll prove the female to my soul, <|nl|> My soul the father; and these two beget <|nl|> A generation of still-breeding thoughts, <|nl|> And these same thoughts people this little world, <|nl|> In humours like the people of this world, <|nl|> For no thought is contented. The better sort, <|nl|> As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd <|nl|> With scruples and do set the word itself <|nl|> Against the word: <|nl|> As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again, <|nl|> 'It is as hard to come as for a camel <|nl|> To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.' <|nl|> Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot <|nl|> Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails <|nl|> May tear a passage through the flinty ribs <|nl|> Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls, <|nl|> And, for they cannot, die in their own pride. <|nl|> Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves <|nl|> That they are not the first of fortune's slaves, <|nl|> Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars <|nl|> Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame, <|nl|> That many have and others must sit there; <|nl|> And in this thought they find a kind of ease, <|nl|> Bearing their own misfortunes on the back <|nl|> Of such as have before endured the like. <|nl|> Thus play I in one person many people, <|nl|> And none contented: sometimes am I king; <|nl|> Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar, <|nl|> And so I am: then crushing penury <|nl|> Persuades me I was better when a king; <|nl|> Then am I king'd again: and by and by <|nl|> Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke, <|nl|> And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be, <|nl|> Nor I nor any man that but man is <|nl|> With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased <|nl|> With being nothing. Music do I hear? <|nl|> Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is, <|nl|> When time is broke and no proportion kept! <|nl|> So is it in the music of men's lives. <|nl|> And here have I the daintiness of ear <|nl|> To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string; <|nl|> But for the concord of my state and time <|nl|> Had not an ear to hear my true time broke. <|nl|> I wasted time, and now doth time waste me; <|nl|> For now hath time made me his numbering clock: <|nl|> My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar <|nl|> Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, <|nl|> Whereto my finger, like a dial's point, <|nl|> Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears. <|nl|> Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is <|nl|> Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart, <|nl|> Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans <|nl|> Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time <|nl|> Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy, <|nl|> While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock. <|nl|> This music mads me; let it sound no more; <|nl|> For though it have holp madmen to their wits, <|nl|> In me it seems it will make wise men mad. <|nl|> Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me! <|nl|> For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard <|nl|> Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Groom: <|nl|> Hail, royal prince! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Thanks, noble peer; <|nl|> The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear. <|nl|> What art thou? and how comest thou hither, <|nl|> Where no man never comes but that sad dog <|nl|> That brings me food to make misfortune live? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Groom: <|nl|> I was a poor groom of thy stable, king, <|nl|> When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York, <|nl|> With much ado at length have gotten leave <|nl|> To look upon my sometimes royal master's face. <|nl|> O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld <|nl|> In London streets, that coronation-day, <|nl|> When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary, <|nl|> That horse that thou so often hast bestrid, <|nl|> That horse that I so carefully have dress'd! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend, <|nl|> How went he under him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Groom: <|nl|> So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back! <|nl|> That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand; <|nl|> This hand hath made him proud with clapping him. <|nl|> Would he not stumble? would he not fall down, <|nl|> Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck <|nl|> Of that proud man that did usurp his back? <|nl|> Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee, <|nl|> Since thou, created to be awed by man, <|nl|> Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse; <|nl|> And yet I bear a burthen like an ass, <|nl|> Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Keeper: <|nl|> Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Groom: <|nl|> What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Keeper: <|nl|> My lord, will't please you to fall to? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Keeper: <|nl|> My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who <|nl|> lately came from the king, commands the contrary. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee! <|nl|> Patience is stale, and I am weary of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Keeper: <|nl|> Help, help, help! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING RICHARD II: <|nl|> How now! what means death in this rude assault? <|nl|> Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument. <|nl|> Go thou, and fill another room in hell. <|nl|> That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire <|nl|> That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand <|nl|> Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land. <|nl|> Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high; <|nl|> Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXTON: <|nl|> As full of valour as of royal blood: <|nl|> Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good! <|nl|> For now the devil, that told me I did well, <|nl|> Says that this deed is chronicled in hell. <|nl|> This dead king to the living king I'll bear <|nl|> Take hence the rest, and give them burial here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear <|nl|> Is that the rebels have consumed with fire <|nl|> Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire; <|nl|> But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not. <|nl|> Welcome, my lord what is the news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness. <|nl|> The next news is, I have to London sent <|nl|> The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent: <|nl|> The manner of their taking may appear <|nl|> At large discoursed in this paper here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains; <|nl|> And to thy worth will add right worthy gains. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LORD FITZWATER: <|nl|> My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London <|nl|> The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely, <|nl|> Two of the dangerous consorted traitors <|nl|> That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot; <|nl|> Right noble is thy merit, well I wot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY PERCY: <|nl|> The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster, <|nl|> With clog of conscience and sour melancholy <|nl|> Hath yielded up his body to the grave; <|nl|> But here is Carlisle living, to abide <|nl|> Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Carlisle, this is your doom: <|nl|> Choose out some secret place, some reverend room, <|nl|> More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life; <|nl|> So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife: <|nl|> For though mine enemy thou hast ever been, <|nl|> High sparks of honour in thee have I seen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXTON: <|nl|> Great king, within this coffin I present <|nl|> Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies <|nl|> The mightiest of thy greatest enemies, <|nl|> Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought <|nl|> A deed of slander with thy fatal hand <|nl|> Upon my head and all this famous land. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXTON: <|nl|> From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HENRY BOLINGBROKE: <|nl|> They love not poison that do poison need, <|nl|> Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead, <|nl|> I hate the murderer, love him murdered. <|nl|> The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour, <|nl|> But neither my good word nor princely favour: <|nl|> With Cain go wander through shades of night, <|nl|> And never show thy head by day nor light. <|nl|> Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe, <|nl|> That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow: <|nl|> Come, mourn with me for that I do lament, <|nl|> And put on sullen black incontinent: <|nl|> I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land, <|nl|> To wash this blood off from my guilty hand: <|nl|> March sadly after; grace my mournings here; <|nl|> In weeping after this untimely bier. <|nl|>  <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> No, for then we should be colliers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> I strike quickly, being moved. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> But thou art not quickly moved to strike. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> A dog of the house of Montague moves me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: <|nl|> therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will <|nl|> take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes <|nl|> to the wall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, <|nl|> are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push <|nl|> Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids <|nl|> to the wall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I <|nl|> have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the <|nl|> maids, and cut off their heads. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> The heads of the maids? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; <|nl|> take it in what sense thou wilt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> They must take it in sense that feel it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and <|nl|> 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou <|nl|> hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes <|nl|> two of the house of the Montagues. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> How! turn thy back and run? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> Fear me not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> No, marry; I fear thee! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as <|nl|> they list. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; <|nl|> which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABRAHAM: <|nl|> Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> I do bite my thumb, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABRAHAM: <|nl|> Do you bite your thumb at us, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> No. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I <|nl|> bite my thumb, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> Do you quarrel, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABRAHAM: <|nl|> Quarrel sir! no, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABRAHAM: <|nl|> No better. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> Well, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREGORY: <|nl|> Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> Yes, better, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABRAHAM: <|nl|> You lie. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SAMPSON: <|nl|> Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Part, fools! <|nl|> Put up your swords; you know not what you do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds? <|nl|> Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword, <|nl|> Or manage it to part these men with me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word, <|nl|> As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee: <|nl|> Have at thee, coward! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down! <|nl|> Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> My sword, I say! Old Montague is come, <|nl|> And flourishes his blade in spite of me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, <|nl|> Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,-- <|nl|> Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts, <|nl|> That quench the fire of your pernicious rage <|nl|> With purple fountains issuing from your veins, <|nl|> On pain of torture, from those bloody hands <|nl|> Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground, <|nl|> And hear the sentence of your moved prince. <|nl|> Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word, <|nl|> By thee, old Capulet, and Montague, <|nl|> Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, <|nl|> And made Verona's ancient citizens <|nl|> Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments, <|nl|> To wield old partisans, in hands as old, <|nl|> Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate: <|nl|> If ever you disturb our streets again, <|nl|> Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. <|nl|> For this time, all the rest depart away: <|nl|> You Capulet; shall go along with me: <|nl|> And, Montague, come you this afternoon, <|nl|> To know our further pleasure in this case, <|nl|> To old Free-town, our common judgment-place. <|nl|> Once more, on pain of death, all men depart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? <|nl|> Speak, nephew, were you by when it began? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Here were the servants of your adversary, <|nl|> And yours, close fighting ere I did approach: <|nl|> I drew to part them: in the instant came <|nl|> The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, <|nl|> Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, <|nl|> He swung about his head and cut the winds, <|nl|> Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn: <|nl|> While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, <|nl|> Came more and more and fought on part and part, <|nl|> Till the prince came, who parted either part. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY MONTAGUE: <|nl|> O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day? <|nl|> Right glad I am he was not at this fray. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun <|nl|> Peer'd forth the golden window of the east, <|nl|> A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; <|nl|> Where, underneath the grove of sycamore <|nl|> That westward rooteth from the city's side, <|nl|> So early walking did I see your son: <|nl|> Towards him I made, but he was ware of me <|nl|> And stole into the covert of the wood: <|nl|> I, measuring his affections by my own, <|nl|> That most are busied when they're most alone, <|nl|> Pursued my humour not pursuing his, <|nl|> And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Many a morning hath he there been seen, <|nl|> With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew. <|nl|> Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; <|nl|> But all so soon as the all-cheering sun <|nl|> Should in the furthest east begin to draw <|nl|> The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, <|nl|> Away from the light steals home my heavy son, <|nl|> And private in his chamber pens himself, <|nl|> Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out <|nl|> And makes himself an artificial night: <|nl|> Black and portentous must this humour prove, <|nl|> Unless good counsel may the cause remove. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> My noble uncle, do you know the cause? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> I neither know it nor can learn of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Have you importuned him by any means? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Both by myself and many other friends: <|nl|> But he, his own affections' counsellor, <|nl|> Is to himself--I will not say how true-- <|nl|> But to himself so secret and so close, <|nl|> So far from sounding and discovery, <|nl|> As is the bud bit with an envious worm, <|nl|> Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, <|nl|> Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. <|nl|> Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow. <|nl|> We would as willingly give cure as know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> See, where he comes: so please you, step aside; <|nl|> I'll know his grievance, or be much denied. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> I would thou wert so happy by thy stay, <|nl|> To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Good-morrow, cousin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Is the day so young? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> But new struck nine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Ay me! sad hours seem long. <|nl|> Was that my father that went hence so fast? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Not having that, which, having, makes them short. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> In love? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Out-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Of love? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Out of her favour, where I am in love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, <|nl|> Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, <|nl|> Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! <|nl|> Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? <|nl|> Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. <|nl|> Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. <|nl|> Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! <|nl|> O any thing, of nothing first create! <|nl|> O heavy lightness! serious vanity! <|nl|> Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms! <|nl|> Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, <|nl|> sick health! <|nl|> Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! <|nl|> This love feel I, that feel no love in this. <|nl|> Dost thou not laugh? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> No, coz, I rather weep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Good heart, at what? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> At thy good heart's oppression. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Why, such is love's transgression. <|nl|> Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, <|nl|> Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest <|nl|> With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown <|nl|> Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. <|nl|> Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs; <|nl|> Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes; <|nl|> Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears: <|nl|> What is it else? a madness most discreet, <|nl|> A choking gall and a preserving sweet. <|nl|> Farewell, my coz. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Soft! I will go along; <|nl|> An if you leave me so, you do me wrong. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here; <|nl|> This is not Romeo, he's some other where. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Tell me in sadness, who is that you love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> What, shall I groan and tell thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Groan! why, no. <|nl|> But sadly tell me who. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Bid a sick man in sadness make his will: <|nl|> Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill! <|nl|> In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit <|nl|> With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit; <|nl|> And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd, <|nl|> From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd. <|nl|> She will not stay the siege of loving terms, <|nl|> Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, <|nl|> Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold: <|nl|> O, she is rich in beauty, only poor, <|nl|> That when she dies with beauty dies her store. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, <|nl|> For beauty starved with her severity <|nl|> Cuts beauty off from all posterity. <|nl|> She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, <|nl|> To merit bliss by making me despair: <|nl|> She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow <|nl|> Do I live dead that live to tell it now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Be ruled by me, forget to think of her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> O, teach me how I should forget to think. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> By giving liberty unto thine eyes; <|nl|> Examine other beauties. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> 'Tis the way <|nl|> To call hers exquisite, in question more: <|nl|> These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows <|nl|> Being black put us in mind they hide the fair; <|nl|> He that is strucken blind cannot forget <|nl|> The precious treasure of his eyesight lost: <|nl|> Show me a mistress that is passing fair, <|nl|> What doth her beauty serve, but as a note <|nl|> Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair? <|nl|> Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> But Montague is bound as well as I, <|nl|> In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think, <|nl|> For men so old as we to keep the peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Of honourable reckoning are you both; <|nl|> And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long. <|nl|> But now, my lord, what say you to my suit? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> But saying o'er what I have said before: <|nl|> My child is yet a stranger in the world; <|nl|> She hath not seen the change of fourteen years, <|nl|> Let two more summers wither in their pride, <|nl|> Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Younger than she are happy mothers made. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> And too soon marr'd are those so early made. <|nl|> The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she, <|nl|> She is the hopeful lady of my earth: <|nl|> But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, <|nl|> My will to her consent is but a part; <|nl|> An she agree, within her scope of choice <|nl|> Lies my consent and fair according voice. <|nl|> This night I hold an old accustom'd feast, <|nl|> Whereto I have invited many a guest, <|nl|> Such as I love; and you, among the store, <|nl|> One more, most welcome, makes my number more. <|nl|> At my poor house look to behold this night <|nl|> Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light: <|nl|> Such comfort as do lusty young men feel <|nl|> When well-apparell'd April on the heel <|nl|> Of limping winter treads, even such delight <|nl|> Among fresh female buds shall you this night <|nl|> Inherit at my house; hear all, all see, <|nl|> And like her most whose merit most shall be: <|nl|> Which on more view, of many mine being one <|nl|> May stand in number, though in reckoning none, <|nl|> Come, go with me. <|nl|> Go, sirrah, trudge about <|nl|> Through fair Verona; find those persons out <|nl|> Whose names are written there, and to them say, <|nl|> My house and welcome on their pleasure stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Find them out whose names are written here! It is <|nl|> written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his <|nl|> yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with <|nl|> his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am <|nl|> sent to find those persons whose names are here <|nl|> writ, and can never find what names the writing <|nl|> person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning, <|nl|> One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish; <|nl|> Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning; <|nl|> One desperate grief cures with another's languish: <|nl|> Take thou some new infection to thy eye, <|nl|> And the rank poison of the old will die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> For what, I pray thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> For your broken shin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Why, Romeo, art thou mad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; <|nl|> Shut up in prison, kept without my food, <|nl|> Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I <|nl|> pray, can you read any thing you see? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Ay, if I know the letters and the language. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Ye say honestly: rest you merry! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Stay, fellow; I can read. <|nl|> 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters; <|nl|> County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady <|nl|> widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely <|nl|> nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine <|nl|> uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece <|nl|> Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin <|nl|> Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair <|nl|> assembly: whither should they come? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Up. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Whither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> To supper; to our house. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Whose house? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> My master's. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the <|nl|> great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house <|nl|> of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. <|nl|> Rest you merry! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> At this same ancient feast of Capulet's <|nl|> Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest, <|nl|> With all the admired beauties of Verona: <|nl|> Go thither; and, with unattainted eye, <|nl|> Compare her face with some that I shall show, <|nl|> And I will make thee think thy swan a crow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> When the devout religion of mine eye <|nl|> Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires; <|nl|> And these, who often drown'd could never die, <|nl|> Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars! <|nl|> One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun <|nl|> Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by, <|nl|> Herself poised with herself in either eye: <|nl|> But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd <|nl|> Your lady's love against some other maid <|nl|> That I will show you shining at this feast, <|nl|> And she shall scant show well that now shows best. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I'll go along, no such sight to be shown, <|nl|> But to rejoice in splendor of mine own. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old, <|nl|> I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird! <|nl|> God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> How now! who calls? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Your mother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Madam, I am here. <|nl|> What is your will? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile, <|nl|> We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again; <|nl|> I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. <|nl|> Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> She's not fourteen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,-- <|nl|> And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four-- <|nl|> She is not fourteen. How long is it now <|nl|> To Lammas-tide? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> A fortnight and odd days. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Even or odd, of all days in the year, <|nl|> Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. <|nl|> Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!-- <|nl|> Were of an age: well, Susan is with God; <|nl|> She was too good for me: but, as I said, <|nl|> On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen; <|nl|> That shall she, marry; I remember it well. <|nl|> 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; <|nl|> And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,-- <|nl|> Of all the days of the year, upon that day: <|nl|> For I had then laid wormwood to my dug, <|nl|> Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall; <|nl|> My lord and you were then at Mantua:-- <|nl|> Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said, <|nl|> When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple <|nl|> Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, <|nl|> To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! <|nl|> Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow, <|nl|> To bid me trudge: <|nl|> And since that time it is eleven years; <|nl|> For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood, <|nl|> She could have run and waddled all about; <|nl|> For even the day before, she broke her brow: <|nl|> And then my husband--God be with his soul! <|nl|> A' was a merry man--took up the child: <|nl|> 'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face? <|nl|> Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit; <|nl|> Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame, <|nl|> The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.' <|nl|> To see, now, how a jest shall come about! <|nl|> I warrant, an I should live a thousand years, <|nl|> I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he; <|nl|> And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh, <|nl|> To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.' <|nl|> And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow <|nl|> A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone; <|nl|> A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly: <|nl|> 'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face? <|nl|> Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age; <|nl|> Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace! <|nl|> Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed: <|nl|> An I might live to see thee married once, <|nl|> I have my wish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme <|nl|> I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet, <|nl|> How stands your disposition to be married? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> It is an honour that I dream not of. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> An honour! were not I thine only nurse, <|nl|> I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Well, think of marriage now; younger than you, <|nl|> Here in Verona, ladies of esteem, <|nl|> Are made already mothers: by my count, <|nl|> I was your mother much upon these years <|nl|> That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief: <|nl|> The valiant Paris seeks you for his love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> A man, young lady! lady, such a man <|nl|> As all the world--why, he's a man of wax. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Verona's summer hath not such a flower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> What say you? can you love the gentleman? <|nl|> This night you shall behold him at our feast; <|nl|> Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, <|nl|> And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; <|nl|> Examine every married lineament, <|nl|> And see how one another lends content <|nl|> And what obscured in this fair volume lies <|nl|> Find written in the margent of his eyes. <|nl|> This precious book of love, this unbound lover, <|nl|> To beautify him, only lacks a cover: <|nl|> The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride <|nl|> For fair without the fair within to hide: <|nl|> That book in many's eyes doth share the glory, <|nl|> That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; <|nl|> So shall you share all that he doth possess, <|nl|> By having him, making yourself no less. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I'll look to like, if looking liking move: <|nl|> But no more deep will I endart mine eye <|nl|> Than your consent gives strength to make it fly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you <|nl|> called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in <|nl|> the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must <|nl|> hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> We follow thee. <|nl|> Juliet, the county stays. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse? <|nl|> Or shall we on without a apology? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> The date is out of such prolixity: <|nl|> We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf, <|nl|> Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath, <|nl|> Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper; <|nl|> Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke <|nl|> After the prompter, for our entrance: <|nl|> But let them measure us by what they will; <|nl|> We'll measure them a measure, and be gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling; <|nl|> Being but heavy, I will bear the light. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes <|nl|> With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead <|nl|> So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, <|nl|> And soar with them above a common bound. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I am too sore enpierced with his shaft <|nl|> To soar with his light feathers, and so bound, <|nl|> I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe: <|nl|> Under love's heavy burden do I sink. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> And, to sink in it, should you burden love; <|nl|> Too great oppression for a tender thing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Is love a tender thing? it is too rough, <|nl|> Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> If love be rough with you, be rough with love; <|nl|> Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down. <|nl|> Give me a case to put my visage in: <|nl|> A visor for a visor! what care I <|nl|> What curious eye doth quote deformities? <|nl|> Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in, <|nl|> But every man betake him to his legs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> A torch for me: let wantons light of heart <|nl|> Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels, <|nl|> For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase; <|nl|> I'll be a candle-holder, and look on. <|nl|> The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word: <|nl|> If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire <|nl|> Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st <|nl|> Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Nay, that's not so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> I mean, sir, in delay <|nl|> We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. <|nl|> Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits <|nl|> Five times in that ere once in our five wits. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> And we mean well in going to this mask; <|nl|> But 'tis no wit to go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Why, may one ask? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I dream'd a dream to-night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> And so did I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Well, what was yours? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> That dreamers often lie. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. <|nl|> She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes <|nl|> In shape no bigger than an agate-stone <|nl|> On the fore-finger of an alderman, <|nl|> Drawn with a team of little atomies <|nl|> Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep; <|nl|> Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs, <|nl|> The cover of the wings of grasshoppers, <|nl|> The traces of the smallest spider's web, <|nl|> The collars of the moonshine's watery beams, <|nl|> Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film, <|nl|> Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, <|nl|> Not so big as a round little worm <|nl|> Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; <|nl|> Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut <|nl|> Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, <|nl|> Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. <|nl|> And in this state she gallops night by night <|nl|> Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; <|nl|> O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight, <|nl|> O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, <|nl|> O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream, <|nl|> Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, <|nl|> Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are: <|nl|> Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, <|nl|> And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; <|nl|> And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail <|nl|> Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep, <|nl|> Then dreams, he of another benefice: <|nl|> Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, <|nl|> And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, <|nl|> Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, <|nl|> Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon <|nl|> Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, <|nl|> And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two <|nl|> And sleeps again. This is that very Mab <|nl|> That plats the manes of horses in the night, <|nl|> And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, <|nl|> Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes: <|nl|> This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, <|nl|> That presses them and learns them first to bear, <|nl|> Making them women of good carriage: <|nl|> This is she-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! <|nl|> Thou talk'st of nothing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> True, I talk of dreams, <|nl|> Which are the children of an idle brain, <|nl|> Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, <|nl|> Which is as thin of substance as the air <|nl|> And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes <|nl|> Even now the frozen bosom of the north, <|nl|> And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, <|nl|> Turning his face to the dew-dropping south. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; <|nl|> Supper is done, and we shall come too late. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I fear, too early: for my mind misgives <|nl|> Some consequence yet hanging in the stars <|nl|> Shall bitterly begin his fearful date <|nl|> With this night's revels and expire the term <|nl|> Of a despised life closed in my breast <|nl|> By some vile forfeit of untimely death. <|nl|> But He, that hath the steerage of my course, <|nl|> Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Strike, drum. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He <|nl|> shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's <|nl|> hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> Away with the joint-stools, remove the <|nl|> court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save <|nl|> me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let <|nl|> the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. <|nl|> Antony, and Potpan! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> Ay, boy, ready. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> You are looked for and called for, asked for and <|nl|> sought for, in the great chamber. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be <|nl|> brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes <|nl|> Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you. <|nl|> Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all <|nl|> Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, <|nl|> She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now? <|nl|> Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day <|nl|> That I have worn a visor and could tell <|nl|> A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, <|nl|> Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone: <|nl|> You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play. <|nl|> A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls. <|nl|> More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up, <|nl|> And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. <|nl|> Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well. <|nl|> Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet; <|nl|> For you and I are past our dancing days: <|nl|> How long is't now since last yourself and I <|nl|> Were in a mask? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Capulet: <|nl|> By'r lady, thirty years. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much: <|nl|> 'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio, <|nl|> Come pentecost as quickly as it will, <|nl|> Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Capulet: <|nl|> 'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir; <|nl|> His son is thirty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Will you tell me that? <|nl|> His son was but a ward two years ago. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> I know not, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! <|nl|> It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night <|nl|> Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear; <|nl|> Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! <|nl|> So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows, <|nl|> As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. <|nl|> The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand, <|nl|> And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. <|nl|> Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! <|nl|> For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> This, by his voice, should be a Montague. <|nl|> Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave <|nl|> Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, <|nl|> To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? <|nl|> Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, <|nl|> To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, <|nl|> A villain that is hither come in spite, <|nl|> To scorn at our solemnity this night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Young Romeo is it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> 'Tis he, that villain Romeo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone; <|nl|> He bears him like a portly gentleman; <|nl|> And, to say truth, Verona brags of him <|nl|> To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth: <|nl|> I would not for the wealth of all the town <|nl|> Here in my house do him disparagement: <|nl|> Therefore be patient, take no note of him: <|nl|> It is my will, the which if thou respect, <|nl|> Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, <|nl|> And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> It fits, when such a villain is a guest: <|nl|> I'll not endure him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> He shall be endured: <|nl|> What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; <|nl|> Am I the master here, or you? go to. <|nl|> You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul! <|nl|> You'll make a mutiny among my guests! <|nl|> You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> Why, uncle, 'tis a shame. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Go to, go to; <|nl|> You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed? <|nl|> This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what: <|nl|> You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time. <|nl|> Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go: <|nl|> Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame! <|nl|> I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting <|nl|> Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. <|nl|> I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall <|nl|> Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, <|nl|> Which mannerly devotion shows in this; <|nl|> For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, <|nl|> And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; <|nl|> They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. <|nl|> Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Then have my lips the sin that they have took. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged! <|nl|> Give me my sin again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> You kiss by the book. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Madam, your mother craves a word with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> What is her mother? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Marry, bachelor, <|nl|> Her mother is the lady of the house, <|nl|> And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous <|nl|> I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal; <|nl|> I tell you, he that can lay hold of her <|nl|> Shall have the chinks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Is she a Capulet? <|nl|> O dear account! my life is my foe's debt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Away, begone; the sport is at the best. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; <|nl|> We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. <|nl|> Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all <|nl|> I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night. <|nl|> More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed. <|nl|> Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late: <|nl|> I'll to my rest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> The son and heir of old Tiberio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> What's he that now is going out of door? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> What's he that follows there, that would not dance? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> I know not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Go ask his name: if he be married. <|nl|> My grave is like to be my wedding bed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> His name is Romeo, and a Montague; <|nl|> The only son of your great enemy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> My only love sprung from my only hate! <|nl|> Too early seen unknown, and known too late! <|nl|> Prodigious birth of love it is to me, <|nl|> That I must love a loathed enemy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> What's this? what's this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> A rhyme I learn'd even now <|nl|> Of one I danced withal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Anon, anon! <|nl|> Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Chorus: <|nl|> Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie, <|nl|> And young affection gapes to be his heir; <|nl|> That fair for which love groan'd for and would die, <|nl|> With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair. <|nl|> Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, <|nl|> Alike betwitched by the charm of looks, <|nl|> But to his foe supposed he must complain, <|nl|> And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks: <|nl|> Being held a foe, he may not have access <|nl|> To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; <|nl|> And she as much in love, her means much less <|nl|> To meet her new-beloved any where: <|nl|> But passion lends them power, time means, to meet <|nl|> Tempering extremities with extreme sweet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Can I go forward when my heart is here? <|nl|> Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Romeo! my cousin Romeo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> He is wise; <|nl|> And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall: <|nl|> Call, good Mercutio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Nay, I'll conjure too. <|nl|> Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! <|nl|> Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh: <|nl|> Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied; <|nl|> Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;' <|nl|> Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word, <|nl|> One nick-name for her purblind son and heir, <|nl|> Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim, <|nl|> When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid! <|nl|> He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not; <|nl|> The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. <|nl|> I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, <|nl|> By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, <|nl|> By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh <|nl|> And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, <|nl|> That in thy likeness thou appear to us! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him <|nl|> To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle <|nl|> Of some strange nature, letting it there stand <|nl|> Till she had laid it and conjured it down; <|nl|> That were some spite: my invocation <|nl|> Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name <|nl|> I conjure only but to raise up him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Come, he hath hid himself among these trees, <|nl|> To be consorted with the humorous night: <|nl|> Blind is his love and best befits the dark. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. <|nl|> Now will he sit under a medlar tree, <|nl|> And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit <|nl|> As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone. <|nl|> Romeo, that she were, O, that she were <|nl|> An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear! <|nl|> Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; <|nl|> This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep: <|nl|> Come, shall we go? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Go, then; for 'tis in vain <|nl|> To seek him here that means not to be found. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> He jests at scars that never felt a wound. <|nl|> But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? <|nl|> It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. <|nl|> Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, <|nl|> Who is already sick and pale with grief, <|nl|> That thou her maid art far more fair than she: <|nl|> Be not her maid, since she is envious; <|nl|> Her vestal livery is but sick and green <|nl|> And none but fools do wear it; cast it off. <|nl|> It is my lady, O, it is my love! <|nl|> O, that she knew she were! <|nl|> She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that? <|nl|> Her eye discourses; I will answer it. <|nl|> I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks: <|nl|> Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, <|nl|> Having some business, do entreat her eyes <|nl|> To twinkle in their spheres till they return. <|nl|> What if her eyes were there, they in her head? <|nl|> The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars, <|nl|> As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven <|nl|> Would through the airy region stream so bright <|nl|> That birds would sing and think it were not night. <|nl|> See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand! <|nl|> O, that I were a glove upon that hand, <|nl|> That I might touch that cheek! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Ay me! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> She speaks: <|nl|> O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art <|nl|> As glorious to this night, being o'er my head <|nl|> As is a winged messenger of heaven <|nl|> Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes <|nl|> Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him <|nl|> When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds <|nl|> And sails upon the bosom of the air. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? <|nl|> Deny thy father and refuse thy name; <|nl|> Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, <|nl|> And I'll no longer be a Capulet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; <|nl|> Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. <|nl|> What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, <|nl|> Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part <|nl|> Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! <|nl|> What's in a name? that which we call a rose <|nl|> By any other name would smell as sweet; <|nl|> So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, <|nl|> Retain that dear perfection which he owes <|nl|> Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, <|nl|> And for that name which is no part of thee <|nl|> Take all myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I take thee at thy word: <|nl|> Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized; <|nl|> Henceforth I never will be Romeo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night <|nl|> So stumblest on my counsel? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> By a name <|nl|> I know not how to tell thee who I am: <|nl|> My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, <|nl|> Because it is an enemy to thee; <|nl|> Had I it written, I would tear the word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words <|nl|> Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound: <|nl|> Art thou not Romeo and a Montague? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? <|nl|> The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, <|nl|> And the place death, considering who thou art, <|nl|> If any of my kinsmen find thee here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; <|nl|> For stony limits cannot hold love out, <|nl|> And what love can do that dares love attempt; <|nl|> Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> If they do see thee, they will murder thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye <|nl|> Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet, <|nl|> And I am proof against their enmity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I would not for the world they saw thee here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight; <|nl|> And but thou love me, let them find me here: <|nl|> My life were better ended by their hate, <|nl|> Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> By whose direction found'st thou out this place? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> By love, who first did prompt me to inquire; <|nl|> He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes. <|nl|> I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far <|nl|> As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea, <|nl|> I would adventure for such merchandise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, <|nl|> Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek <|nl|> For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night <|nl|> Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny <|nl|> What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! <|nl|> Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' <|nl|> And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, <|nl|> Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries <|nl|> Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, <|nl|> If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully: <|nl|> Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, <|nl|> I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay, <|nl|> So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. <|nl|> In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, <|nl|> And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light: <|nl|> But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true <|nl|> Than those that have more cunning to be strange. <|nl|> I should have been more strange, I must confess, <|nl|> But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware, <|nl|> My true love's passion: therefore pardon me, <|nl|> And not impute this yielding to light love, <|nl|> Which the dark night hath so discovered. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear <|nl|> That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, <|nl|> That monthly changes in her circled orb, <|nl|> Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> What shall I swear by? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Do not swear at all; <|nl|> Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, <|nl|> Which is the god of my idolatry, <|nl|> And I'll believe thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> If my heart's dear love-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee, <|nl|> I have no joy of this contract to-night: <|nl|> It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; <|nl|> Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be <|nl|> Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! <|nl|> This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, <|nl|> May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. <|nl|> Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest <|nl|> Come to thy heart as that within my breast! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> What satisfaction canst thou have to-night? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I gave thee mine before thou didst request it: <|nl|> And yet I would it were to give again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> But to be frank, and give it thee again. <|nl|> And yet I wish but for the thing I have: <|nl|> My bounty is as boundless as the sea, <|nl|> My love as deep; the more I give to thee, <|nl|> The more I have, for both are infinite. <|nl|> I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu! <|nl|> Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. <|nl|> Stay but a little, I will come again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard. <|nl|> Being in night, all this is but a dream, <|nl|> Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. <|nl|> If that thy bent of love be honourable, <|nl|> Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, <|nl|> By one that I'll procure to come to thee, <|nl|> Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; <|nl|> And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay <|nl|> And follow thee my lord throughout the world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well, <|nl|> I do beseech thee-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> By and by, I come:-- <|nl|> To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief: <|nl|> To-morrow will I send. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> So thrive my soul-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> A thousand times good night! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. <|nl|> Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from <|nl|> their books, <|nl|> But love from love, toward school with heavy looks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice, <|nl|> To lure this tassel-gentle back again! <|nl|> Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud; <|nl|> Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, <|nl|> And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine, <|nl|> With repetition of my Romeo's name. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> It is my soul that calls upon my name: <|nl|> How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, <|nl|> Like softest music to attending ears! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Romeo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> My dear? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> At what o'clock to-morrow <|nl|> Shall I send to thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> At the hour of nine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then. <|nl|> I have forgot why I did call thee back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Let me stand here till thou remember it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, <|nl|> Remembering how I love thy company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, <|nl|> Forgetting any other home but this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone: <|nl|> And yet no further than a wanton's bird; <|nl|> Who lets it hop a little from her hand, <|nl|> Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, <|nl|> And with a silk thread plucks it back again, <|nl|> So loving-jealous of his liberty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I would I were thy bird. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Sweet, so would I: <|nl|> Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. <|nl|> Good night, good night! parting is such <|nl|> sweet sorrow, <|nl|> That I shall say good night till it be morrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! <|nl|> Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! <|nl|> Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell, <|nl|> His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night, <|nl|> Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light, <|nl|> And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels <|nl|> From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels: <|nl|> Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye, <|nl|> The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, <|nl|> I must up-fill this osier cage of ours <|nl|> With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers. <|nl|> The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb; <|nl|> What is her burying grave that is her womb, <|nl|> And from her womb children of divers kind <|nl|> We sucking on her natural bosom find, <|nl|> Many for many virtues excellent, <|nl|> None but for some and yet all different. <|nl|> O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies <|nl|> In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities: <|nl|> For nought so vile that on the earth doth live <|nl|> But to the earth some special good doth give, <|nl|> Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use <|nl|> Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: <|nl|> Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied; <|nl|> And vice sometimes by action dignified. <|nl|> Within the infant rind of this small flower <|nl|> Poison hath residence and medicine power: <|nl|> For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; <|nl|> Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. <|nl|> Two such opposed kings encamp them still <|nl|> In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; <|nl|> And where the worser is predominant, <|nl|> Full soon the canker death eats up that plant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Good morrow, father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Benedicite! <|nl|> What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? <|nl|> Young son, it argues a distemper'd head <|nl|> So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed: <|nl|> Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye, <|nl|> And where care lodges, sleep will never lie; <|nl|> But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain <|nl|> Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign: <|nl|> Therefore thy earliness doth me assure <|nl|> Thou art up-roused by some distemperature; <|nl|> Or if not so, then here I hit it right, <|nl|> Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no; <|nl|> I have forgot that name, and that name's woe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again. <|nl|> I have been feasting with mine enemy, <|nl|> Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, <|nl|> That's by me wounded: both our remedies <|nl|> Within thy help and holy physic lies: <|nl|> I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, <|nl|> My intercession likewise steads my foe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; <|nl|> Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set <|nl|> On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: <|nl|> As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; <|nl|> And all combined, save what thou must combine <|nl|> By holy marriage: when and where and how <|nl|> We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow, <|nl|> I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, <|nl|> That thou consent to marry us to-day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! <|nl|> Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, <|nl|> So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies <|nl|> Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. <|nl|> Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine <|nl|> Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! <|nl|> How much salt water thrown away in waste, <|nl|> To season love, that of it doth not taste! <|nl|> The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, <|nl|> Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears; <|nl|> Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit <|nl|> Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet: <|nl|> If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, <|nl|> Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline: <|nl|> And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then, <|nl|> Women may fall, when there's no strength in men. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> For doting, not for loving, pupil mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> And bad'st me bury love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Not in a grave, <|nl|> To lay one in, another out to have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now <|nl|> Doth grace for grace and love for love allow; <|nl|> The other did not so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> O, she knew well <|nl|> Thy love did read by rote and could not spell. <|nl|> But come, young waverer, come, go with me, <|nl|> In one respect I'll thy assistant be; <|nl|> For this alliance may so happy prove, <|nl|> To turn your households' rancour to pure love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Where the devil should this Romeo be? <|nl|> Came he not home to-night? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Not to his father's; I spoke with his man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. <|nl|> Torments him so, that he will sure run mad. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, <|nl|> Hath sent a letter to his father's house. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> A challenge, on my life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Romeo will answer it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Any man that can write may answer a letter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he <|nl|> dares, being dared. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a <|nl|> white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a <|nl|> love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the <|nl|> blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to <|nl|> encounter Tybalt? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Why, what is Tybalt? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is <|nl|> the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as <|nl|> you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and <|nl|> proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and <|nl|> the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk <|nl|> button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the <|nl|> very first house, of the first and second cause: <|nl|> ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the <|nl|> hai! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> The what? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting <|nl|> fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu, <|nl|> a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good <|nl|> whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing, <|nl|> grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with <|nl|> these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these <|nl|> perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form, <|nl|> that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their <|nl|> bones, their bones! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh, <|nl|> how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers <|nl|> that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a <|nl|> kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to <|nl|> be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy; <|nl|> Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey <|nl|> eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior <|nl|> Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation <|nl|> to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit <|nl|> fairly last night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in <|nl|> such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> That's as much as to say, such a case as yours <|nl|> constrains a man to bow in the hams. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Meaning, to court'sy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Thou hast most kindly hit it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> A most courteous exposition. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Pink for flower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Why, then is my pump well flowered. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast <|nl|> worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it <|nl|> is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> O single-soled jest, solely singular for the <|nl|> singleness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have <|nl|> done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of <|nl|> thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five: <|nl|> was I with you there for the goose? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast <|nl|> not there for the goose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> I will bite thee by the ear for that jest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Nay, good goose, bite not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most <|nl|> sharp sauce. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> And is it not well served in to a sweet goose? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an <|nl|> inch narrow to an ell broad! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added <|nl|> to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? <|nl|> now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art <|nl|> thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature: <|nl|> for this drivelling love is like a great natural, <|nl|> that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Stop there, stop there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: <|nl|> for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and <|nl|> meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Here's goodly gear! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> A sail, a sail! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Two, two; a shirt and a smock. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Peter! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> Anon! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> My fan, Peter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the <|nl|> fairer face. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> God ye good morrow, gentlemen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> God ye good den, fair gentlewoman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Is it good den? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> 'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the <|nl|> dial is now upon the prick of noon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Out upon you! what a man are you! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to <|nl|> mar. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,' <|nl|> quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I <|nl|> may find the young Romeo? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when <|nl|> you have found him than he was when you sought him: <|nl|> I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> You say well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith; <|nl|> wisely, wisely. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with <|nl|> you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> She will indite him to some supper. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> What hast thou found? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, <|nl|> that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent. <|nl|> An old hare hoar, <|nl|> And an old hare hoar, <|nl|> Is very good meat in lent <|nl|> But a hare that is hoar <|nl|> Is too much for a score, <|nl|> When it hoars ere it be spent. <|nl|> Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll <|nl|> to dinner, thither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I will follow you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, <|nl|> 'lady, lady, lady.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy <|nl|> merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, <|nl|> and will speak more in a minute than he will stand <|nl|> to in a month. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him <|nl|> down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such <|nl|> Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall. <|nl|> Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am <|nl|> none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by <|nl|> too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon <|nl|> should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare <|nl|> draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a <|nl|> good quarrel, and the law on my side. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about <|nl|> me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word: <|nl|> and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you <|nl|> out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself: <|nl|> but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into <|nl|> a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross <|nl|> kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman <|nl|> is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double <|nl|> with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered <|nl|> to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I <|nl|> protest unto thee-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much: <|nl|> Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as <|nl|> I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Bid her devise <|nl|> Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; <|nl|> And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell <|nl|> Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> No truly sir; not a penny. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Go to; I say you shall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall: <|nl|> Within this hour my man shall be with thee <|nl|> And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair; <|nl|> Which to the high top-gallant of my joy <|nl|> Must be my convoy in the secret night. <|nl|> Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains: <|nl|> Farewell; commend me to thy mistress. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> What say'st thou, my dear nurse? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say, <|nl|> Two may keep counsel, putting one away? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NURSE: <|nl|> Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord, <|nl|> Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there <|nl|> is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain <|nl|> lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief <|nl|> see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her <|nl|> sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer <|nl|> man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks <|nl|> as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not <|nl|> rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for <|nl|> the--No; I know it begins with some other <|nl|> letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of <|nl|> it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good <|nl|> to hear it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Commend me to thy lady. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Ay, a thousand times. <|nl|> Peter! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> Anon! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse; <|nl|> In half an hour she promised to return. <|nl|> Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so. <|nl|> O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts, <|nl|> Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, <|nl|> Driving back shadows over louring hills: <|nl|> Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love, <|nl|> And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. <|nl|> Now is the sun upon the highmost hill <|nl|> Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve <|nl|> Is three long hours, yet she is not come. <|nl|> Had she affections and warm youthful blood, <|nl|> She would be as swift in motion as a ball; <|nl|> My words would bandy her to my sweet love, <|nl|> And his to me: <|nl|> But old folks, many feign as they were dead; <|nl|> Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead. <|nl|> O God, she comes! <|nl|> O honey nurse, what news? <|nl|> Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Peter, stay at the gate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad? <|nl|> Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily; <|nl|> If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news <|nl|> By playing it to me with so sour a face. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: <|nl|> Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: <|nl|> Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile? <|nl|> Do you not see that I am out of breath? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath <|nl|> To say to me that thou art out of breath? <|nl|> The excuse that thou dost make in this delay <|nl|> Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse. <|nl|> Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that; <|nl|> Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance: <|nl|> Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not <|nl|> how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his <|nl|> face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels <|nl|> all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body, <|nl|> though they be not to be talked on, yet they are <|nl|> past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy, <|nl|> but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy <|nl|> ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> No, no: but all this did I know before. <|nl|> What says he of our marriage? what of that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! <|nl|> It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. <|nl|> My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back! <|nl|> Beshrew your heart for sending me about, <|nl|> To catch my death with jaunting up and down! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. <|nl|> Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a <|nl|> courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I <|nl|> warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Where is my mother! why, she is within; <|nl|> Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest! <|nl|> 'Your love says, like an honest gentleman, <|nl|> Where is your mother?' <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> O God's lady dear! <|nl|> Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow; <|nl|> Is this the poultice for my aching bones? <|nl|> Henceforward do your messages yourself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell; <|nl|> There stays a husband to make you a wife: <|nl|> Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks, <|nl|> They'll be in scarlet straight at any news. <|nl|> Hie you to church; I must another way, <|nl|> To fetch a ladder, by the which your love <|nl|> Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark: <|nl|> I am the drudge and toil in your delight, <|nl|> But you shall bear the burden soon at night. <|nl|> Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> So smile the heavens upon this holy act, <|nl|> That after hours with sorrow chide us not! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can, <|nl|> It cannot countervail the exchange of joy <|nl|> That one short minute gives me in her sight: <|nl|> Do thou but close our hands with holy words, <|nl|> Then love-devouring death do what he dare; <|nl|> It is enough I may but call her mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> These violent delights have violent ends <|nl|> And in their triumph die, like fire and powder, <|nl|> Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey <|nl|> Is loathsome in his own deliciousness <|nl|> And in the taste confounds the appetite: <|nl|> Therefore love moderately; long love doth so; <|nl|> Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow. <|nl|> Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot <|nl|> Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint: <|nl|> A lover may bestride the gossamer <|nl|> That idles in the wanton summer air, <|nl|> And yet not fall; so light is vanity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Good even to my ghostly confessor. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> As much to him, else is his thanks too much. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy <|nl|> Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more <|nl|> To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath <|nl|> This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue <|nl|> Unfold the imagined happiness that both <|nl|> Receive in either by this dear encounter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, <|nl|> Brags of his substance, not of ornament: <|nl|> They are but beggars that can count their worth; <|nl|> But my true love is grown to such excess <|nl|> I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Come, come with me, and we will make short work; <|nl|> For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone <|nl|> Till holy church incorporate two in one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire: <|nl|> The day is hot, the Capulets abroad, <|nl|> And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl; <|nl|> For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Thou art like one of those fellows that when he <|nl|> enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword <|nl|> upon the table and says 'God send me no need of <|nl|> thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws <|nl|> it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Am I like such a fellow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as <|nl|> any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as <|nl|> soon moody to be moved. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> And what to? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Nay, an there were two such, we should have none <|nl|> shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why, <|nl|> thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more, <|nl|> or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou <|nl|> wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no <|nl|> other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what <|nl|> eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? <|nl|> Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of <|nl|> meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as <|nl|> an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a <|nl|> man for coughing in the street, because he hath <|nl|> wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun: <|nl|> didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing <|nl|> his new doublet before Easter? with another, for <|nl|> tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou <|nl|> wilt tutor me from quarrelling! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man <|nl|> should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> The fee-simple! O simple! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> By my head, here come the Capulets. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> By my heel, I care not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> Follow me close, for I will speak to them. <|nl|> Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> And but one word with one of us? couple it with <|nl|> something; make it a word and a blow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you <|nl|> will give me occasion. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Could you not take some occasion without giving? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an <|nl|> thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but <|nl|> discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall <|nl|> make you dance. 'Zounds, consort! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> We talk here in the public haunt of men: <|nl|> Either withdraw unto some private place, <|nl|> And reason coldly of your grievances, <|nl|> Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze; <|nl|> I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery: <|nl|> Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower; <|nl|> Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford <|nl|> No better term than this,--thou art a villain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee <|nl|> Doth much excuse the appertaining rage <|nl|> To such a greeting: villain am I none; <|nl|> Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries <|nl|> That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I do protest, I never injured thee, <|nl|> But love thee better than thou canst devise, <|nl|> Till thou shalt know the reason of my love: <|nl|> And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender <|nl|> As dearly as my own,--be satisfied. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> O calm, dishonourable, vile submission! <|nl|> Alla stoccata carries it away. <|nl|> Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> What wouldst thou have with me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine <|nl|> lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you <|nl|> shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the <|nl|> eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher <|nl|> by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your <|nl|> ears ere it be out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> I am for you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Come, sir, your passado. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons. <|nl|> Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage! <|nl|> Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath <|nl|> Forbidden bandying in Verona streets: <|nl|> Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> I am hurt. <|nl|> A plague o' both your houses! I am sped. <|nl|> Is he gone, and hath nothing? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> What, art thou hurt? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough. <|nl|> Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a <|nl|> church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for <|nl|> me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I <|nl|> am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o' <|nl|> both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a <|nl|> cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a <|nl|> rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of <|nl|> arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I <|nl|> was hurt under your arm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I thought all for the best. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MERCUTIO: <|nl|> Help me into some house, Benvolio, <|nl|> Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses! <|nl|> They have made worms' meat of me: I have it, <|nl|> And soundly too: your houses! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> This gentleman, the prince's near ally, <|nl|> My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt <|nl|> In my behalf; my reputation stain'd <|nl|> With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour <|nl|> Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet, <|nl|> Thy beauty hath made me effeminate <|nl|> And in my temper soften'd valour's steel! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead! <|nl|> That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds, <|nl|> Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> This day's black fate on more days doth depend; <|nl|> This but begins the woe, others must end. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain! <|nl|> Away to heaven, respective lenity, <|nl|> And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now! <|nl|> Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again, <|nl|> That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul <|nl|> Is but a little way above our heads, <|nl|> Staying for thine to keep him company: <|nl|> Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TYBALT: <|nl|> Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, <|nl|> Shalt with him hence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> This shall determine that. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Romeo, away, be gone! <|nl|> The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. <|nl|> Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death, <|nl|> If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> O, I am fortune's fool! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Why dost thou stay? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio? <|nl|> Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> There lies that Tybalt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Citizen: <|nl|> Up, sir, go with me; <|nl|> I charge thee in the princes name, obey. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Where are the vile beginners of this fray? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> O noble prince, I can discover all <|nl|> The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl: <|nl|> There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, <|nl|> That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child! <|nl|> O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt <|nl|> O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true, <|nl|> For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague. <|nl|> O cousin, cousin! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BENVOLIO: <|nl|> Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay; <|nl|> Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink <|nl|> How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal <|nl|> Your high displeasure: all this uttered <|nl|> With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd, <|nl|> Could not take truce with the unruly spleen <|nl|> Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts <|nl|> With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast, <|nl|> Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point, <|nl|> And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats <|nl|> Cold death aside, and with the other sends <|nl|> It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity, <|nl|> Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud, <|nl|> 'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than <|nl|> his tongue, <|nl|> His agile arm beats down their fatal points, <|nl|> And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm <|nl|> An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life <|nl|> Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; <|nl|> But by and by comes back to Romeo, <|nl|> Who had but newly entertain'd revenge, <|nl|> And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I <|nl|> Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain. <|nl|> And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. <|nl|> This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> He is a kinsman to the Montague; <|nl|> Affection makes him false; he speaks not true: <|nl|> Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, <|nl|> And all those twenty could but kill one life. <|nl|> I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give; <|nl|> Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio; <|nl|> Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend; <|nl|> His fault concludes but what the law should end, <|nl|> The life of Tybalt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> And for that offence <|nl|> Immediately we do exile him hence: <|nl|> I have an interest in your hate's proceeding, <|nl|> My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; <|nl|> But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine <|nl|> That you shall all repent the loss of mine: <|nl|> I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; <|nl|> Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses: <|nl|> Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste, <|nl|> Else, when he's found, that hour is his last. <|nl|> Bear hence this body and attend our will: <|nl|> Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, <|nl|> Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner <|nl|> As Phaethon would whip you to the west, <|nl|> And bring in cloudy night immediately. <|nl|> Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, <|nl|> That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo <|nl|> Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen. <|nl|> Lovers can see to do their amorous rites <|nl|> By their own beauties; or, if love be blind, <|nl|> It best agrees with night. Come, civil night, <|nl|> Thou sober-suited matron, all in black, <|nl|> And learn me how to lose a winning match, <|nl|> Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods: <|nl|> Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks, <|nl|> With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold, <|nl|> Think true love acted simple modesty. <|nl|> Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night; <|nl|> For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night <|nl|> Whiter than new snow on a raven's back. <|nl|> Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night, <|nl|> Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die, <|nl|> Take him and cut him out in little stars, <|nl|> And he will make the face of heaven so fine <|nl|> That all the world will be in love with night <|nl|> And pay no worship to the garish sun. <|nl|> O, I have bought the mansion of a love, <|nl|> But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold, <|nl|> Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day <|nl|> As is the night before some festival <|nl|> To an impatient child that hath new robes <|nl|> And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse, <|nl|> And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks <|nl|> But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. <|nl|> Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords <|nl|> That Romeo bid thee fetch? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Ay, ay, the cords. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead! <|nl|> We are undone, lady, we are undone! <|nl|> Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Can heaven be so envious? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Romeo can, <|nl|> Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo! <|nl|> Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus? <|nl|> This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell. <|nl|> Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,' <|nl|> And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more <|nl|> Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice: <|nl|> I am not I, if there be such an I; <|nl|> Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.' <|nl|> If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no: <|nl|> Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,-- <|nl|> God save the mark!--here on his manly breast: <|nl|> A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse; <|nl|> Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood, <|nl|> All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once! <|nl|> To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty! <|nl|> Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here; <|nl|> And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! <|nl|> O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman! <|nl|> That ever I should live to see thee dead! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> What storm is this that blows so contrary? <|nl|> Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead? <|nl|> My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord? <|nl|> Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! <|nl|> For who is living, if those two are gone? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished; <|nl|> Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> It did, it did; alas the day, it did! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face! <|nl|> Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave? <|nl|> Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! <|nl|> Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! <|nl|> Despised substance of divinest show! <|nl|> Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st, <|nl|> A damned saint, an honourable villain! <|nl|> O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell, <|nl|> When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend <|nl|> In moral paradise of such sweet flesh? <|nl|> Was ever book containing such vile matter <|nl|> So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell <|nl|> In such a gorgeous palace! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> There's no trust, <|nl|> No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured, <|nl|> All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. <|nl|> Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae: <|nl|> These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old. <|nl|> Shame come to Romeo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Blister'd be thy tongue <|nl|> For such a wish! he was not born to shame: <|nl|> Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit; <|nl|> For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd <|nl|> Sole monarch of the universal earth. <|nl|> O, what a beast was I to chide at him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband? <|nl|> Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, <|nl|> When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it? <|nl|> But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin? <|nl|> That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband: <|nl|> Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring; <|nl|> Your tributary drops belong to woe, <|nl|> Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy. <|nl|> My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain; <|nl|> And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband: <|nl|> All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then? <|nl|> Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death, <|nl|> That murder'd me: I would forget it fain; <|nl|> But, O, it presses to my memory, <|nl|> Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds: <|nl|> 'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;' <|nl|> That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,' <|nl|> Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death <|nl|> Was woe enough, if it had ended there: <|nl|> Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship <|nl|> And needly will be rank'd with other griefs, <|nl|> Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,' <|nl|> Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both, <|nl|> Which modern lamentations might have moved? <|nl|> But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death, <|nl|> 'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word, <|nl|> Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, <|nl|> All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!' <|nl|> There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, <|nl|> In that word's death; no words can that woe sound. <|nl|> Where is my father, and my mother, nurse? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse: <|nl|> Will you go to them? I will bring you thither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent, <|nl|> When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment. <|nl|> Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled, <|nl|> Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled: <|nl|> He made you for a highway to my bed; <|nl|> But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed. <|nl|> Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed; <|nl|> And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo <|nl|> To comfort you: I wot well where he is. <|nl|> Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night: <|nl|> I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O, find him! give this ring to my true knight, <|nl|> And bid him come to take his last farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man: <|nl|> Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts, <|nl|> And thou art wedded to calamity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Father, what news? what is the prince's doom? <|nl|> What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand, <|nl|> That I yet know not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Too familiar <|nl|> Is my dear son with such sour company: <|nl|> I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips, <|nl|> Not body's death, but body's banishment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;' <|nl|> For exile hath more terror in his look, <|nl|> Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Hence from Verona art thou banished: <|nl|> Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> There is no world without Verona walls, <|nl|> But purgatory, torture, hell itself. <|nl|> Hence-banished is banish'd from the world, <|nl|> And world's exile is death: then banished, <|nl|> Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment, <|nl|> Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe, <|nl|> And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness! <|nl|> Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, <|nl|> Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, <|nl|> And turn'd that black word death to banishment: <|nl|> This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here, <|nl|> Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog <|nl|> And little mouse, every unworthy thing, <|nl|> Live here in heaven and may look on her; <|nl|> But Romeo may not: more validity, <|nl|> More honourable state, more courtship lives <|nl|> In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize <|nl|> On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand <|nl|> And steal immortal blessing from her lips, <|nl|> Who even in pure and vestal modesty, <|nl|> Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin; <|nl|> But Romeo may not; he is banished: <|nl|> Flies may do this, but I from this must fly: <|nl|> They are free men, but I am banished. <|nl|> And say'st thou yet that exile is not death? <|nl|> Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife, <|nl|> No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean, <|nl|> But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'? <|nl|> O friar, the damned use that word in hell; <|nl|> Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart, <|nl|> Being a divine, a ghostly confessor, <|nl|> A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd, <|nl|> To mangle me with that word 'banished'? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> O, thou wilt speak again of banishment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> I'll give thee armour to keep off that word: <|nl|> Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, <|nl|> To comfort thee, though thou art banished. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy! <|nl|> Unless philosophy can make a Juliet, <|nl|> Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom, <|nl|> It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> O, then I see that madmen have no ears. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> How should they, when that wise men have no eyes? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Let me dispute with thee of thy estate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel: <|nl|> Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love, <|nl|> An hour but married, Tybalt murdered, <|nl|> Doting like me and like me banished, <|nl|> Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair, <|nl|> And fall upon the ground, as I do now, <|nl|> Taking the measure of an unmade grave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans, <|nl|> Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise; <|nl|> Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up; <|nl|> Run to my study. By and by! God's will, <|nl|> What simpleness is this! I come, I come! <|nl|> Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Welcome, then. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar, <|nl|> Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> O, he is even in my mistress' case, <|nl|> Just in her case! O woful sympathy! <|nl|> Piteous predicament! Even so lies she, <|nl|> Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. <|nl|> Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man: <|nl|> For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand; <|nl|> Why should you fall into so deep an O? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Nurse! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her? <|nl|> Doth she not think me an old murderer, <|nl|> Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy <|nl|> With blood removed but little from her own? <|nl|> Where is she? and how doth she? and what says <|nl|> My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; <|nl|> And now falls on her bed; and then starts up, <|nl|> And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries, <|nl|> And then down falls again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> As if that name, <|nl|> Shot from the deadly level of a gun, <|nl|> Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand <|nl|> Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me, <|nl|> In what vile part of this anatomy <|nl|> Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack <|nl|> The hateful mansion. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Hold thy desperate hand: <|nl|> Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art: <|nl|> Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote <|nl|> The unreasonable fury of a beast: <|nl|> Unseemly woman in a seeming man! <|nl|> Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both! <|nl|> Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order, <|nl|> I thought thy disposition better temper'd. <|nl|> Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself? <|nl|> And stay thy lady too that lives in thee, <|nl|> By doing damned hate upon thyself? <|nl|> Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? <|nl|> Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet <|nl|> In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose. <|nl|> Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit; <|nl|> Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all, <|nl|> And usest none in that true use indeed <|nl|> Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit: <|nl|> Thy noble shape is but a form of wax, <|nl|> Digressing from the valour of a man; <|nl|> Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury, <|nl|> Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish; <|nl|> Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love, <|nl|> Misshapen in the conduct of them both, <|nl|> Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask, <|nl|> Is set afire by thine own ignorance, <|nl|> And thou dismember'd with thine own defence. <|nl|> What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive, <|nl|> For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead; <|nl|> There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee, <|nl|> But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too: <|nl|> The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend <|nl|> And turns it to exile; there art thou happy: <|nl|> A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back; <|nl|> Happiness courts thee in her best array; <|nl|> But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench, <|nl|> Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love: <|nl|> Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. <|nl|> Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed, <|nl|> Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her: <|nl|> But look thou stay not till the watch be set, <|nl|> For then thou canst not pass to Mantua; <|nl|> Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time <|nl|> To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, <|nl|> Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back <|nl|> With twenty hundred thousand times more joy <|nl|> Than thou went'st forth in lamentation. <|nl|> Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady; <|nl|> And bid her hasten all the house to bed, <|nl|> Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto: <|nl|> Romeo is coming. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night <|nl|> To hear good counsel: O, what learning is! <|nl|> My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir: <|nl|> Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> How well my comfort is revived by this! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state: <|nl|> Either be gone before the watch be set, <|nl|> Or by the break of day disguised from hence: <|nl|> Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man, <|nl|> And he shall signify from time to time <|nl|> Every good hap to you that chances here: <|nl|> Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> But that a joy past joy calls out on me, <|nl|> It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily, <|nl|> That we have had no time to move our daughter: <|nl|> Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly, <|nl|> And so did I:--Well, we were born to die. <|nl|> 'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night: <|nl|> I promise you, but for your company, <|nl|> I would have been a-bed an hour ago. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> These times of woe afford no time to woo. <|nl|> Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> I will, and know her mind early to-morrow; <|nl|> To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender <|nl|> Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled <|nl|> In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not. <|nl|> Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed; <|nl|> Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love; <|nl|> And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next-- <|nl|> But, soft! what day is this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Monday, my lord, <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon, <|nl|> O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her, <|nl|> She shall be married to this noble earl. <|nl|> Will you be ready? do you like this haste? <|nl|> We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two; <|nl|> For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, <|nl|> It may be thought we held him carelessly, <|nl|> Being our kinsman, if we revel much: <|nl|> Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends, <|nl|> And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then. <|nl|> Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed, <|nl|> Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day. <|nl|> Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho! <|nl|> Afore me! it is so very very late, <|nl|> That we may call it early by and by. <|nl|> Good night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: <|nl|> It was the nightingale, and not the lark, <|nl|> That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear; <|nl|> Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree: <|nl|> Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> It was the lark, the herald of the morn, <|nl|> No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks <|nl|> Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: <|nl|> Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day <|nl|> Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. <|nl|> I must be gone and live, or stay and die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I: <|nl|> It is some meteor that the sun exhales, <|nl|> To be to thee this night a torch-bearer, <|nl|> And light thee on thy way to Mantua: <|nl|> Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death; <|nl|> I am content, so thou wilt have it so. <|nl|> I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, <|nl|> 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; <|nl|> Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat <|nl|> The vaulty heaven so high above our heads: <|nl|> I have more care to stay than will to go: <|nl|> Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so. <|nl|> How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away! <|nl|> It is the lark that sings so out of tune, <|nl|> Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. <|nl|> Some say the lark makes sweet division; <|nl|> This doth not so, for she divideth us: <|nl|> Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes, <|nl|> O, now I would they had changed voices too! <|nl|> Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray, <|nl|> Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day, <|nl|> O, now be gone; more light and light it grows. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> More light and light; more dark and dark our woes! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Madam! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Nurse? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Your lady mother is coming to your chamber: <|nl|> The day is broke; be wary, look about. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Then, window, let day in, and let life out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend! <|nl|> I must hear from thee every day in the hour, <|nl|> For in a minute there are many days: <|nl|> O, by this count I shall be much in years <|nl|> Ere I again behold my Romeo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Farewell! <|nl|> I will omit no opportunity <|nl|> That may convey my greetings, love, to thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O think'st thou we shall ever meet again? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve <|nl|> For sweet discourses in our time to come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O God, I have an ill-divining soul! <|nl|> Methinks I see thee, now thou art below, <|nl|> As one dead in the bottom of a tomb: <|nl|> Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> And trust me, love, in my eye so do you: <|nl|> Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle: <|nl|> If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him. <|nl|> That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune; <|nl|> For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long, <|nl|> But send him back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother? <|nl|> Is she not down so late, or up so early? <|nl|> What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Why, how now, Juliet! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Madam, I am not well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Evermore weeping for your cousin's death? <|nl|> What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears? <|nl|> An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live; <|nl|> Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love; <|nl|> But much of grief shows still some want of wit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend <|nl|> Which you weep for. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Feeling so the loss, <|nl|> Cannot choose but ever weep the friend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death, <|nl|> As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> What villain madam? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> That same villain, Romeo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> That is, because the traitor murderer lives. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands: <|nl|> Would none but I might venge my cousin's death! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not: <|nl|> Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua, <|nl|> Where that same banish'd runagate doth live, <|nl|> Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram, <|nl|> That he shall soon keep Tybalt company: <|nl|> And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Indeed, I never shall be satisfied <|nl|> With Romeo, till I behold him--dead-- <|nl|> Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd. <|nl|> Madam, if you could find out but a man <|nl|> To bear a poison, I would temper it; <|nl|> That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, <|nl|> Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors <|nl|> To hear him named, and cannot come to him. <|nl|> To wreak the love I bore my cousin <|nl|> Upon his body that slaughter'd him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man. <|nl|> But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> And joy comes well in such a needy time: <|nl|> What are they, I beseech your ladyship? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child; <|nl|> One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, <|nl|> Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy, <|nl|> That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Madam, in happy time, what day is that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn, <|nl|> The gallant, young and noble gentleman, <|nl|> The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, <|nl|> Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too, <|nl|> He shall not make me there a joyful bride. <|nl|> I wonder at this haste; that I must wed <|nl|> Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo. <|nl|> I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, <|nl|> I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear, <|nl|> It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, <|nl|> Rather than Paris. These are news indeed! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Here comes your father; tell him so yourself, <|nl|> And see how he will take it at your hands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew; <|nl|> But for the sunset of my brother's son <|nl|> It rains downright. <|nl|> How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears? <|nl|> Evermore showering? In one little body <|nl|> Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind; <|nl|> For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, <|nl|> Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is, <|nl|> Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs; <|nl|> Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them, <|nl|> Without a sudden calm, will overset <|nl|> Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife! <|nl|> Have you deliver'd to her our decree? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks. <|nl|> I would the fool were married to her grave! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife. <|nl|> How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks? <|nl|> Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest, <|nl|> Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought <|nl|> So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have: <|nl|> Proud can I never be of what I hate; <|nl|> But thankful even for hate, that is meant love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this? <|nl|> 'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;' <|nl|> And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you, <|nl|> Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds, <|nl|> But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next, <|nl|> To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church, <|nl|> Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. <|nl|> Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage! <|nl|> You tallow-face! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Fie, fie! what, are you mad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Good father, I beseech you on my knees, <|nl|> Hear me with patience but to speak a word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch! <|nl|> I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday, <|nl|> Or never after look me in the face: <|nl|> Speak not, reply not, do not answer me; <|nl|> My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest <|nl|> That God had lent us but this only child; <|nl|> But now I see this one is one too much, <|nl|> And that we have a curse in having her: <|nl|> Out on her, hilding! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> God in heaven bless her! <|nl|> You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue, <|nl|> Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> I speak no treason. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> O, God ye god-den. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> May not one speak? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Peace, you mumbling fool! <|nl|> Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl; <|nl|> For here we need it not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> You are too hot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> God's bread! it makes me mad: <|nl|> Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play, <|nl|> Alone, in company, still my care hath been <|nl|> To have her match'd: and having now provided <|nl|> A gentleman of noble parentage, <|nl|> Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd, <|nl|> Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts, <|nl|> Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man; <|nl|> And then to have a wretched puling fool, <|nl|> A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender, <|nl|> To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love, <|nl|> I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.' <|nl|> But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you: <|nl|> Graze where you will you shall not house with me: <|nl|> Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest. <|nl|> Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise: <|nl|> An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend; <|nl|> And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in <|nl|> the streets, <|nl|> For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee, <|nl|> Nor what is mine shall never do thee good: <|nl|> Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Is there no pity sitting in the clouds, <|nl|> That sees into the bottom of my grief? <|nl|> O, sweet my mother, cast me not away! <|nl|> Delay this marriage for a month, a week; <|nl|> Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed <|nl|> In that dim monument where Tybalt lies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word: <|nl|> Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented? <|nl|> My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven; <|nl|> How shall that faith return again to earth, <|nl|> Unless that husband send it me from heaven <|nl|> By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me. <|nl|> Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems <|nl|> Upon so soft a subject as myself! <|nl|> What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy? <|nl|> Some comfort, nurse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Faith, here it is. <|nl|> Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing, <|nl|> That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you; <|nl|> Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth. <|nl|> Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, <|nl|> I think it best you married with the county. <|nl|> O, he's a lovely gentleman! <|nl|> Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam, <|nl|> Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye <|nl|> As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, <|nl|> I think you are happy in this second match, <|nl|> For it excels your first: or if it did not, <|nl|> Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were, <|nl|> As living here and you no use of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Speakest thou from thy heart? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> And from my soul too; <|nl|> Or else beshrew them both. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Amen! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> What? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. <|nl|> Go in: and tell my lady I am gone, <|nl|> Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell, <|nl|> To make confession and to be absolved. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend! <|nl|> Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn, <|nl|> Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue <|nl|> Which she hath praised him with above compare <|nl|> So many thousand times? Go, counsellor; <|nl|> Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain. <|nl|> I'll to the friar, to know his remedy: <|nl|> If all else fail, myself have power to die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> On Thursday, sir? the time is very short. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> My father Capulet will have it so; <|nl|> And I am nothing slow to slack his haste. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> You say you do not know the lady's mind: <|nl|> Uneven is the course, I like it not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death, <|nl|> And therefore have I little talk'd of love; <|nl|> For Venus smiles not in a house of tears. <|nl|> Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous <|nl|> That she doth give her sorrow so much sway, <|nl|> And in his wisdom hastes our marriage, <|nl|> To stop the inundation of her tears; <|nl|> Which, too much minded by herself alone, <|nl|> May be put from her by society: <|nl|> Now do you know the reason of this haste. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Happily met, my lady and my wife! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> That may be must be, love, on Thursday next. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> What must be shall be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> That's a certain text. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Come you to make confession to this father? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> To answer that, I should confess to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Do not deny to him that you love me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I will confess to you that I love him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> So will ye, I am sure, that you love me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> If I do so, it will be of more price, <|nl|> Being spoke behind your back, than to your face. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> The tears have got small victory by that; <|nl|> For it was bad enough before their spite. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> That is no slander, sir, which is a truth; <|nl|> And what I spake, I spake it to my face. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> It may be so, for it is not mine own. <|nl|> Are you at leisure, holy father, now; <|nl|> Or shall I come to you at evening mass? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now. <|nl|> My lord, we must entreat the time alone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> God shield I should disturb devotion! <|nl|> Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye: <|nl|> Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O shut the door! and when thou hast done so, <|nl|> Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief; <|nl|> It strains me past the compass of my wits: <|nl|> I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, <|nl|> On Thursday next be married to this county. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this, <|nl|> Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it: <|nl|> If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help, <|nl|> Do thou but call my resolution wise, <|nl|> And with this knife I'll help it presently. <|nl|> God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands; <|nl|> And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd, <|nl|> Shall be the label to another deed, <|nl|> Or my true heart with treacherous revolt <|nl|> Turn to another, this shall slay them both: <|nl|> Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time, <|nl|> Give me some present counsel, or, behold, <|nl|> 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife <|nl|> Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that <|nl|> Which the commission of thy years and art <|nl|> Could to no issue of true honour bring. <|nl|> Be not so long to speak; I long to die, <|nl|> If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope, <|nl|> Which craves as desperate an execution. <|nl|> As that is desperate which we would prevent. <|nl|> If, rather than to marry County Paris, <|nl|> Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, <|nl|> Then is it likely thou wilt undertake <|nl|> A thing like death to chide away this shame, <|nl|> That copest with death himself to scape from it: <|nl|> And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, <|nl|> From off the battlements of yonder tower; <|nl|> Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk <|nl|> Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears; <|nl|> Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house, <|nl|> O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones, <|nl|> With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls; <|nl|> Or bid me go into a new-made grave <|nl|> And hide me with a dead man in his shroud; <|nl|> Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble; <|nl|> And I will do it without fear or doubt, <|nl|> To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent <|nl|> To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow: <|nl|> To-morrow night look that thou lie alone; <|nl|> Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber: <|nl|> Take thou this vial, being then in bed, <|nl|> And this distilled liquor drink thou off; <|nl|> When presently through all thy veins shall run <|nl|> A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse <|nl|> Shall keep his native progress, but surcease: <|nl|> No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest; <|nl|> The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade <|nl|> To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall, <|nl|> Like death, when he shuts up the day of life; <|nl|> Each part, deprived of supple government, <|nl|> Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death: <|nl|> And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death <|nl|> Thou shalt continue two and forty hours, <|nl|> And then awake as from a pleasant sleep. <|nl|> Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes <|nl|> To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead: <|nl|> Then, as the manner of our country is, <|nl|> In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier <|nl|> Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault <|nl|> Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. <|nl|> In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, <|nl|> Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, <|nl|> And hither shall he come: and he and I <|nl|> Will watch thy waking, and that very night <|nl|> Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. <|nl|> And this shall free thee from this present shame; <|nl|> If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear, <|nl|> Abate thy valour in the acting it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous <|nl|> In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed <|nl|> To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford. <|nl|> Farewell, dear father! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> So many guests invite as here are writ. <|nl|> Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they <|nl|> can lick their fingers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> How canst thou try them so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his <|nl|> own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his <|nl|> fingers goes not with me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Go, be gone. <|nl|> We shall be much unfurnished for this time. <|nl|> What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Ay, forsooth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Well, he may chance to do some good on her: <|nl|> A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> See where she comes from shrift with merry look. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin <|nl|> Of disobedient opposition <|nl|> To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd <|nl|> By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here, <|nl|> And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you! <|nl|> Henceforward I am ever ruled by you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Send for the county; go tell him of this: <|nl|> I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell; <|nl|> And gave him what becomed love I might, <|nl|> Not step o'er the bounds of modesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up: <|nl|> This is as't should be. Let me see the county; <|nl|> Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither. <|nl|> Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar, <|nl|> Our whole city is much bound to him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Nurse, will you go with me into my closet, <|nl|> To help me sort such needful ornaments <|nl|> As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> No, not till Thursday; there is time enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY  CAPULET: <|nl|> We shall be short in our provision: <|nl|> 'Tis now near night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Tush, I will stir about, <|nl|> And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife: <|nl|> Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her; <|nl|> I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone; <|nl|> I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho! <|nl|> They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself <|nl|> To County Paris, to prepare him up <|nl|> Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light, <|nl|> Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse, <|nl|> I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night, <|nl|> For I have need of many orisons <|nl|> To move the heavens to smile upon my state, <|nl|> Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> What, are you busy, ho? need you my help? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries <|nl|> As are behoveful for our state to-morrow: <|nl|> So please you, let me now be left alone, <|nl|> And let the nurse this night sit up with you; <|nl|> For, I am sure, you have your hands full all, <|nl|> In this so sudden business. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Good night: <|nl|> Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again. <|nl|> I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins, <|nl|> That almost freezes up the heat of life: <|nl|> I'll call them back again to comfort me: <|nl|> Nurse! What should she do here? <|nl|> My dismal scene I needs must act alone. <|nl|> Come, vial. <|nl|> What if this mixture do not work at all? <|nl|> Shall I be married then to-morrow morning? <|nl|> No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there. <|nl|> What if it be a poison, which the friar <|nl|> Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead, <|nl|> Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd, <|nl|> Because he married me before to Romeo? <|nl|> I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not, <|nl|> For he hath still been tried a holy man. <|nl|> How if, when I am laid into the tomb, <|nl|> I wake before the time that Romeo <|nl|> Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point! <|nl|> Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault, <|nl|> To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in, <|nl|> And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? <|nl|> Or, if I live, is it not very like, <|nl|> The horrible conceit of death and night, <|nl|> Together with the terror of the place,-- <|nl|> As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, <|nl|> Where, for these many hundred years, the bones <|nl|> Of all my buried ancestors are packed: <|nl|> Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, <|nl|> Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, <|nl|> At some hours in the night spirits resort;-- <|nl|> Alack, alack, is it not like that I, <|nl|> So early waking, what with loathsome smells, <|nl|> And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth, <|nl|> That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:-- <|nl|> O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, <|nl|> Environed with all these hideous fears? <|nl|> And madly play with my forefather's joints? <|nl|> And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud? <|nl|> And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, <|nl|> As with a club, dash out my desperate brains? <|nl|> O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost <|nl|> Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body <|nl|> Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay! <|nl|> Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> They call for dates and quinces in the pastry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd, <|nl|> The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock: <|nl|> Look to the baked meats, good Angelica: <|nl|> Spare not for the cost. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Go, you cot-quean, go, <|nl|> Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow <|nl|> For this night's watching. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now <|nl|> All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; <|nl|> But I will watch you from such watching now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> A jealous hood, a jealous hood! <|nl|> Now, fellow, <|nl|> What's there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Make haste, make haste. <|nl|> Sirrah, fetch drier logs: <|nl|> Call Peter, he will show thee where they are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> I have a head, sir, that will find out logs, <|nl|> And never trouble Peter for the matter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha! <|nl|> Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day: <|nl|> The county will be here with music straight, <|nl|> For so he said he would: I hear him near. <|nl|> Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say! <|nl|> Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up; <|nl|> I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste, <|nl|> Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already: <|nl|> Make haste, I say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she: <|nl|> Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed! <|nl|> Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride! <|nl|> What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now; <|nl|> Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant, <|nl|> The County Paris hath set up his rest, <|nl|> That you shall rest but little. God forgive me, <|nl|> Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep! <|nl|> I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam! <|nl|> Ay, let the county take you in your bed; <|nl|> He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be? <|nl|> What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again! <|nl|> I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady! <|nl|> Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead! <|nl|> O, well-a-day, that ever I was born! <|nl|> Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> What noise is here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> O lamentable day! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> What is the matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Look, look! O heavy day! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> O me, O me! My child, my only life, <|nl|> Revive, look up, or I will die with thee! <|nl|> Help, help! Call help. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold: <|nl|> Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff; <|nl|> Life and these lips have long been separated: <|nl|> Death lies on her like an untimely frost <|nl|> Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> O lamentable day! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> O woful time! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail, <|nl|> Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Come, is the bride ready to go to church? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Ready to go, but never to return. <|nl|> O son! the night before thy wedding-day <|nl|> Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies, <|nl|> Flower as she was, deflowered by him. <|nl|> Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir; <|nl|> My daughter he hath wedded: I will die, <|nl|> And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Have I thought long to see this morning's face, <|nl|> And doth it give me such a sight as this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day! <|nl|> Most miserable hour that e'er time saw <|nl|> In lasting labour of his pilgrimage! <|nl|> But one, poor one, one poor and loving child, <|nl|> But one thing to rejoice and solace in, <|nl|> And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> O woe! O woful, woful, woful day! <|nl|> Most lamentable day, most woful day, <|nl|> That ever, ever, I did yet behold! <|nl|> O day! O day! O day! O hateful day! <|nl|> Never was seen so black a day as this: <|nl|> O woful day, O woful day! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain! <|nl|> Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd, <|nl|> By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown! <|nl|> O love! O life! not life, but love in death! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd! <|nl|> Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now <|nl|> To murder, murder our solemnity? <|nl|> O child! O child! my soul, and not my child! <|nl|> Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead; <|nl|> And with my child my joys are buried. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not <|nl|> In these confusions. Heaven and yourself <|nl|> Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all, <|nl|> And all the better is it for the maid: <|nl|> Your part in her you could not keep from death, <|nl|> But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. <|nl|> The most you sought was her promotion; <|nl|> For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced: <|nl|> And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced <|nl|> Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? <|nl|> O, in this love, you love your child so ill, <|nl|> That you run mad, seeing that she is well: <|nl|> She's not well married that lives married long; <|nl|> But she's best married that dies married young. <|nl|> Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary <|nl|> On this fair corse; and, as the custom is, <|nl|> In all her best array bear her to church: <|nl|> For though fond nature bids us an lament, <|nl|> Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> All things that we ordained festival, <|nl|> Turn from their office to black funeral; <|nl|> Our instruments to melancholy bells, <|nl|> Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast, <|nl|> Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change, <|nl|> Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse, <|nl|> And all things change them to the contrary. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; <|nl|> And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare <|nl|> To follow this fair corse unto her grave: <|nl|> The heavens do lour upon you for some ill; <|nl|> Move them no more by crossing their high will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Musician: <|nl|> Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nurse: <|nl|> Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up; <|nl|> For, well you know, this is a pitiful case. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Musician: <|nl|> Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's <|nl|> ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Musician: <|nl|> Why 'Heart's ease?' <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My <|nl|> heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump, <|nl|> to comfort me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Musician: <|nl|> Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> You will not, then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Musician: <|nl|> No. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> I will then give it you soundly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Musician: <|nl|> What will you give us? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> No money, on my faith, but the gleek; <|nl|> I will give you the minstrel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Musician: <|nl|> Then I will give you the serving-creature. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on <|nl|> your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you, <|nl|> I'll fa you; do you note me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Musician: <|nl|> An you re us and fa us, you note us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Musician: <|nl|> Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you <|nl|> with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer <|nl|> me like men: <|nl|> 'When griping grief the heart doth wound, <|nl|> And doleful dumps the mind oppress, <|nl|> Then music with her silver sound'-- <|nl|> why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver <|nl|> sound'? What say you, Simon Catling? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Musician: <|nl|> Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Musician: <|nl|> I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Musician: <|nl|> Faith, I know not what to say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say <|nl|> for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,' <|nl|> because musicians have no gold for sounding: <|nl|> 'Then music with her silver sound <|nl|> With speedy help doth lend redress.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Musician: <|nl|> What a pestilent knave is this same! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Musician: <|nl|> Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the <|nl|> mourners, and stay dinner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, <|nl|> My dreams presage some joyful news at hand: <|nl|> My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne; <|nl|> And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit <|nl|> Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. <|nl|> I dreamt my lady came and found me dead-- <|nl|> Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave <|nl|> to think!-- <|nl|> And breathed such life with kisses in my lips, <|nl|> That I revived, and was an emperor. <|nl|> Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd, <|nl|> When but love's shadows are so rich in joy! <|nl|> News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar! <|nl|> Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? <|nl|> How doth my lady? Is my father well? <|nl|> How fares my Juliet? that I ask again; <|nl|> For nothing can be ill, if she be well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> Then she is well, and nothing can be ill: <|nl|> Her body sleeps in Capel's monument, <|nl|> And her immortal part with angels lives. <|nl|> I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault, <|nl|> And presently took post to tell it you: <|nl|> O, pardon me for bringing these ill news, <|nl|> Since you did leave it for my office, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Is it even so? then I defy you, stars! <|nl|> Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper, <|nl|> And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> I do beseech you, sir, have patience: <|nl|> Your looks are pale and wild, and do import <|nl|> Some misadventure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Tush, thou art deceived: <|nl|> Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do. <|nl|> Hast thou no letters to me from the friar? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> No, my good lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> No matter: get thee gone, <|nl|> And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight. <|nl|> Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night. <|nl|> Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift <|nl|> To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! <|nl|> I do remember an apothecary,-- <|nl|> And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted <|nl|> In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows, <|nl|> Culling of simples; meagre were his looks, <|nl|> Sharp misery had worn him to the bones: <|nl|> And in his needy shop a tortoise hung, <|nl|> An alligator stuff'd, and other skins <|nl|> Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves <|nl|> A beggarly account of empty boxes, <|nl|> Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds, <|nl|> Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses, <|nl|> Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show. <|nl|> Noting this penury, to myself I said <|nl|> 'An if a man did need a poison now, <|nl|> Whose sale is present death in Mantua, <|nl|> Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.' <|nl|> O, this same thought did but forerun my need; <|nl|> And this same needy man must sell it me. <|nl|> As I remember, this should be the house. <|nl|> Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. <|nl|> What, ho! apothecary! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Apothecary: <|nl|> Who calls so loud? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor: <|nl|> Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have <|nl|> A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear <|nl|> As will disperse itself through all the veins <|nl|> That the life-weary taker may fall dead <|nl|> And that the trunk may be discharged of breath <|nl|> As violently as hasty powder fired <|nl|> Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Apothecary: <|nl|> Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law <|nl|> Is death to any he that utters them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness, <|nl|> And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks, <|nl|> Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes, <|nl|> Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back; <|nl|> The world is not thy friend nor the world's law; <|nl|> The world affords no law to make thee rich; <|nl|> Then be not poor, but break it, and take this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Apothecary: <|nl|> My poverty, but not my will, consents. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I pay thy poverty, and not thy will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Apothecary: <|nl|> Put this in any liquid thing you will, <|nl|> And drink it off; and, if you had the strength <|nl|> Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls, <|nl|> Doing more murders in this loathsome world, <|nl|> Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell. <|nl|> I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none. <|nl|> Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh. <|nl|> Come, cordial and not poison, go with me <|nl|> To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR JOHN: <|nl|> Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> This same should be the voice of Friar John. <|nl|> Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo? <|nl|> Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR JOHN: <|nl|> Going to find a bare-foot brother out <|nl|> One of our order, to associate me, <|nl|> Here in this city visiting the sick, <|nl|> And finding him, the searchers of the town, <|nl|> Suspecting that we both were in a house <|nl|> Where the infectious pestilence did reign, <|nl|> Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth; <|nl|> So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR JOHN: <|nl|> I could not send it,--here it is again,-- <|nl|> Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, <|nl|> So fearful were they of infection. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood, <|nl|> The letter was not nice but full of charge <|nl|> Of dear import, and the neglecting it <|nl|> May do much danger. Friar John, go hence; <|nl|> Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight <|nl|> Unto my cell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR JOHN: <|nl|> Brother, I'll go and bring it thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Now must I to the monument alone; <|nl|> Within three hours will fair Juliet wake: <|nl|> She will beshrew me much that Romeo <|nl|> Hath had no notice of these accidents; <|nl|> But I will write again to Mantua, <|nl|> And keep her at my cell till Romeo come; <|nl|> Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof: <|nl|> Yet put it out, for I would not be seen. <|nl|> Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along, <|nl|> Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground; <|nl|> So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread, <|nl|> Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves, <|nl|> But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me, <|nl|> As signal that thou hear'st something approach. <|nl|> Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAGE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,-- <|nl|> O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;-- <|nl|> Which with sweet water nightly I will dew, <|nl|> Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans: <|nl|> The obsequies that I for thee will keep <|nl|> Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep. <|nl|> The boy gives warning something doth approach. <|nl|> What cursed foot wanders this way to-night, <|nl|> To cross my obsequies and true love's rite? <|nl|> What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. <|nl|> Hold, take this letter; early in the morning <|nl|> See thou deliver it to my lord and father. <|nl|> Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee, <|nl|> Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof, <|nl|> And do not interrupt me in my course. <|nl|> Why I descend into this bed of death, <|nl|> Is partly to behold my lady's face; <|nl|> But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger <|nl|> A precious ring, a ring that I must use <|nl|> In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone: <|nl|> But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry <|nl|> In what I further shall intend to do, <|nl|> By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint <|nl|> And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs: <|nl|> The time and my intents are savage-wild, <|nl|> More fierce and more inexorable far <|nl|> Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that: <|nl|> Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, <|nl|> Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth, <|nl|> Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open, <|nl|> And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> This is that banish'd haughty Montague, <|nl|> That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief, <|nl|> It is supposed, the fair creature died; <|nl|> And here is come to do some villanous shame <|nl|> To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him. <|nl|> Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague! <|nl|> Can vengeance be pursued further than death? <|nl|> Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee: <|nl|> Obey, and go with me; for thou must die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> I must indeed; and therefore came I hither. <|nl|> Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man; <|nl|> Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone; <|nl|> Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth, <|nl|> Put not another sin upon my head, <|nl|> By urging me to fury: O, be gone! <|nl|> By heaven, I love thee better than myself; <|nl|> For I come hither arm'd against myself: <|nl|> Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say, <|nl|> A madman's mercy bade thee run away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> I do defy thy conjurations, <|nl|> And apprehend thee for a felon here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAGE: <|nl|> O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PARIS: <|nl|> O, I am slain! <|nl|> If thou be merciful, <|nl|> Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ROMEO: <|nl|> In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face. <|nl|> Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris! <|nl|> What said my man, when my betossed soul <|nl|> Did not attend him as we rode? I think <|nl|> He told me Paris should have married Juliet: <|nl|> Said he not so? or did I dream it so? <|nl|> Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet, <|nl|> To think it was so? O, give me thy hand, <|nl|> One writ with me in sour misfortune's book! <|nl|> I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave; <|nl|> A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth, <|nl|> For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes <|nl|> This vault a feasting presence full of light. <|nl|> Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd. <|nl|> How oft when men are at the point of death <|nl|> Have they been merry! which their keepers call <|nl|> A lightning before death: O, how may I <|nl|> Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife! <|nl|> Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, <|nl|> Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: <|nl|> Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet <|nl|> Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, <|nl|> And death's pale flag is not advanced there. <|nl|> Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet? <|nl|> O, what more favour can I do to thee, <|nl|> Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain <|nl|> To sunder his that was thine enemy? <|nl|> Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet, <|nl|> Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe <|nl|> That unsubstantial death is amorous, <|nl|> And that the lean abhorred monster keeps <|nl|> Thee here in dark to be his paramour? <|nl|> For fear of that, I still will stay with thee; <|nl|> And never from this palace of dim night <|nl|> Depart again: here, here will I remain <|nl|> With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here <|nl|> Will I set up my everlasting rest, <|nl|> And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars <|nl|> From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last! <|nl|> Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you <|nl|> The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss <|nl|> A dateless bargain to engrossing death! <|nl|> Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide! <|nl|> Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on <|nl|> The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark! <|nl|> Here's to my love! <|nl|> O true apothecary! <|nl|> Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night <|nl|> Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend, <|nl|> What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light <|nl|> To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern, <|nl|> It burneth in the Capel's monument. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master, <|nl|> One that you love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Who is it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> Romeo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> How long hath he been there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> Full half an hour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Go with me to the vault. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> I dare not, sir <|nl|> My master knows not but I am gone hence; <|nl|> And fearfully did menace me with death, <|nl|> If I did stay to look on his intents. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me: <|nl|> O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> As I did sleep under this yew-tree here, <|nl|> I dreamt my master and another fought, <|nl|> And that my master slew him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> Romeo! <|nl|> Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains <|nl|> The stony entrance of this sepulchre? <|nl|> What mean these masterless and gory swords <|nl|> To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? <|nl|> Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too? <|nl|> And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour <|nl|> Is guilty of this lamentable chance! <|nl|> The lady stirs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> O comfortable friar! where is my lord? <|nl|> I do remember well where I should be, <|nl|> And there I am. Where is my Romeo? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest <|nl|> Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep: <|nl|> A greater power than we can contradict <|nl|> Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away. <|nl|> Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead; <|nl|> And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee <|nl|> Among a sisterhood of holy nuns: <|nl|> Stay not to question, for the watch is coming; <|nl|> Come, go, good Juliet, <|nl|> I dare no longer stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Go, get thee hence, for I will not away. <|nl|> What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand? <|nl|> Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end: <|nl|> O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop <|nl|> To help me after? I will kiss thy lips; <|nl|> Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, <|nl|> To make die with a restorative. <|nl|> Thy lips are warm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger! <|nl|> This is thy sheath; <|nl|> there rust, and let me die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAGE: <|nl|> This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard: <|nl|> Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach. <|nl|> Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain, <|nl|> And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, <|nl|> Who here hath lain these two days buried. <|nl|> Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets: <|nl|> Raise up the Montagues: some others search: <|nl|> We see the ground whereon these woes do lie; <|nl|> But the true ground of all these piteous woes <|nl|> We cannot without circumstance descry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Watchman: <|nl|> Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Watchman: <|nl|> Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps: <|nl|> We took this mattock and this spade from him, <|nl|> As he was coming from this churchyard side. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> A great suspicion: stay the friar too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> What misadventure is so early up, <|nl|> That calls our person from our morning's rest? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> What should it be, that they so shriek abroad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> The people in the street cry Romeo, <|nl|> Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run, <|nl|> With open outcry toward our monument. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> What fear is this which startles in our ears? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; <|nl|> And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, <|nl|> Warm and new kill'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man; <|nl|> With instruments upon them, fit to open <|nl|> These dead men's tombs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! <|nl|> This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house <|nl|> Is empty on the back of Montague,-- <|nl|> And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY CAPULET: <|nl|> O me! this sight of death is as a bell, <|nl|> That warns my old age to a sepulchre. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Come, Montague; for thou art early up, <|nl|> To see thy son and heir more early down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night; <|nl|> Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath: <|nl|> What further woe conspires against mine age? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Look, and thou shalt see. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> O thou untaught! what manners is in this? <|nl|> To press before thy father to a grave? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, <|nl|> Till we can clear these ambiguities, <|nl|> And know their spring, their head, their <|nl|> true descent; <|nl|> And then will I be general of your woes, <|nl|> And lead you even to death: meantime forbear, <|nl|> And let mischance be slave to patience. <|nl|> Bring forth the parties of suspicion. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> I am the greatest, able to do least, <|nl|> Yet most suspected, as the time and place <|nl|> Doth make against me of this direful murder; <|nl|> And here I stand, both to impeach and purge <|nl|> Myself condemned and myself excused. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Then say at once what thou dost know in this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR LAURENCE: <|nl|> I will be brief, for my short date of breath <|nl|> Is not so long as is a tedious tale. <|nl|> Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; <|nl|> And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife: <|nl|> I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day <|nl|> Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death <|nl|> Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city, <|nl|> For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined. <|nl|> You, to remove that siege of grief from her, <|nl|> Betroth'd and would have married her perforce <|nl|> To County Paris: then comes she to me, <|nl|> And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean <|nl|> To rid her from this second marriage, <|nl|> Or in my cell there would she kill herself. <|nl|> Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art, <|nl|> A sleeping potion; which so took effect <|nl|> As I intended, for it wrought on her <|nl|> The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo, <|nl|> That he should hither come as this dire night, <|nl|> To help to take her from her borrow'd grave, <|nl|> Being the time the potion's force should cease. <|nl|> But he which bore my letter, Friar John, <|nl|> Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight <|nl|> Return'd my letter back. Then all alone <|nl|> At the prefixed hour of her waking, <|nl|> Came I to take her from her kindred's vault; <|nl|> Meaning to keep her closely at my cell, <|nl|> Till I conveniently could send to Romeo: <|nl|> But when I came, some minute ere the time <|nl|> Of her awaking, here untimely lay <|nl|> The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. <|nl|> She wakes; and I entreated her come forth, <|nl|> And bear this work of heaven with patience: <|nl|> But then a noise did scare me from the tomb; <|nl|> And she, too desperate, would not go with me, <|nl|> But, as it seems, did violence on herself. <|nl|> All this I know; and to the marriage <|nl|> Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this <|nl|> Miscarried by my fault, let my old life <|nl|> Be sacrificed, some hour before his time, <|nl|> Unto the rigour of severest law. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> We still have known thee for a holy man. <|nl|> Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BALTHASAR: <|nl|> I brought my master news of Juliet's death; <|nl|> And then in post he came from Mantua <|nl|> To this same place, to this same monument. <|nl|> This letter he early bid me give his father, <|nl|> And threatened me with death, going in the vault, <|nl|> I departed not and left him there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> Give me the letter; I will look on it. <|nl|> Where is the county's page, that raised the watch? <|nl|> Sirrah, what made your master in this place? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAGE: <|nl|> He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave; <|nl|> And bid me stand aloof, and so I did: <|nl|> Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; <|nl|> And by and by my master drew on him; <|nl|> And then I ran away to call the watch. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> This letter doth make good the friar's words, <|nl|> Their course of love, the tidings of her death: <|nl|> And here he writes that he did buy a poison <|nl|> Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal <|nl|> Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet. <|nl|> Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague! <|nl|> See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate, <|nl|> That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love. <|nl|> And I for winking at your discords too <|nl|> Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> O brother Montague, give me thy hand: <|nl|> This is my daughter's jointure, for no more <|nl|> Can I demand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> But I can give thee more: <|nl|> For I will raise her statue in pure gold; <|nl|> That while Verona by that name is known, <|nl|> There shall no figure at such rate be set <|nl|> As that of true and faithful Juliet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAPULET: <|nl|> As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie; <|nl|> Poor sacrifices of our enmity! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> A glooming peace this morning with it brings; <|nl|> The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head: <|nl|> Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; <|nl|> Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished: <|nl|> For never was a story of more woe <|nl|> Than this of Juliet and her Romeo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> I wonder how the king escaped our hands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> While we pursued the horsemen of the north, <|nl|> He slily stole away and left his men: <|nl|> Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland, <|nl|> Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat, <|nl|> Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself, <|nl|> Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast, <|nl|> Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in <|nl|> Were by the swords of common soldiers slain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham, <|nl|> Is either slain or wounded dangerously; <|nl|> I cleft his beaver with a downright blow: <|nl|> That this is true, father, behold his blood. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood, <|nl|> Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Speak thou for me and tell them what I did. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Richard hath best deserved of all my sons. <|nl|> But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> And so do I. Victorious Prince of York, <|nl|> Before I see thee seated in that throne <|nl|> Which now the house of Lancaster usurps, <|nl|> I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close. <|nl|> This is the palace of the fearful king, <|nl|> And this the regal seat: possess it, York; <|nl|> For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs' <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will; <|nl|> For hither we have broken in by force. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords; <|nl|> And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> And when the king comes, offer no violence, <|nl|> Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> The queen this day here holds her parliament, <|nl|> But little thinks we shall be of her council: <|nl|> By words or blows here let us win our right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> The bloody parliament shall this be call'd, <|nl|> Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king, <|nl|> And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice <|nl|> Hath made us by-words to our enemies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute; <|nl|> I mean to take possession of my right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Neither the king, nor he that loves him best, <|nl|> The proudest he that holds up Lancaster, <|nl|> Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells. <|nl|> I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares: <|nl|> Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits, <|nl|> Even in the chair of state: belike he means, <|nl|> Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer, <|nl|> To aspire unto the crown and reign as king. <|nl|> Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father. <|nl|> And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge <|nl|> On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> If I be not, heavens be revenged on me! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WESTMORELAND: <|nl|> What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down: <|nl|> My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Patience is for poltroons, such as he: <|nl|> He durst not sit there, had your father lived. <|nl|> My gracious lord, here in the parliament <|nl|> Let us assail the family of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Ah, know you not the city favours them, <|nl|> And they have troops of soldiers at their beck? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart, <|nl|> To make a shambles of the parliament-house! <|nl|> Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats <|nl|> Shall be the war that Henry means to use. <|nl|> Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne, <|nl|> and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet; <|nl|> I am thy sovereign. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> I am thine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> Thy father was a traitor to the crown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown <|nl|> In following this usurping Henry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Whom should he follow but his natural king? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne? <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> It must and shall be so: content thyself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WESTMORELAND: <|nl|> He is both king and Duke of Lancaster; <|nl|> And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget <|nl|> That we are those which chased you from the field <|nl|> And slew your fathers, and with colours spread <|nl|> March'd through the city to the palace gates. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief; <|nl|> And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WESTMORELAND: <|nl|> Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons, <|nl|> Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives <|nl|> Than drops of blood were in my father's veins. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words, <|nl|> I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger <|nl|> As shall revenge his death before I stir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats! <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Will you we show our title to the crown? <|nl|> If not, our swords shall plead it in the field. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown? <|nl|> Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York; <|nl|> Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March: <|nl|> I am the son of Henry the Fifth, <|nl|> Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop <|nl|> And seized upon their towns and provinces. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> The lord protector lost it, and not I: <|nl|> When I was crown'd I was but nine months old. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose. <|nl|> Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Sweet father, do so; set it on your head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms, <|nl|> Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Sons, peace! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords; <|nl|> And be you silent and attentive too, <|nl|> For he that interrupts him shall not live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne, <|nl|> Wherein my grandsire and my father sat? <|nl|> No: first shall war unpeople this my realm; <|nl|> Ay, and their colours, often borne in France, <|nl|> And now in England to our heart's great sorrow, <|nl|> Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords? <|nl|> My title's good, and better far than his. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> 'Twas by rebellion against his king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> What then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> An if he may, then am I lawful king; <|nl|> For Richard, in the view of many lords, <|nl|> Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth, <|nl|> Whose heir my father was, and I am his. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> He rose against him, being his sovereign, <|nl|> And made him to resign his crown perforce. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd, <|nl|> Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> No; for he could not so resign his crown <|nl|> But that the next heir should succeed and reign. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> His is the right, and therefore pardon me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> My conscience tells me he is lawful king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st, <|nl|> Think not that Henry shall be so deposed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Deposed he shall be, in despite of all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power, <|nl|> Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent, <|nl|> Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud, <|nl|> Can set the duke up in despite of me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> King Henry, be thy title right or wrong, <|nl|> Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence: <|nl|> May that ground gape and swallow me alive, <|nl|> Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart! <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown. <|nl|> What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Do right unto this princely Duke of York, <|nl|> Or I will fill the house with armed men, <|nl|> And over the chair of state, where now he sits, <|nl|> Write up his title with usurping blood. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word: <|nl|> Let me for this my life-time reign as king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs, <|nl|> And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> I am content: Richard Plantagenet, <|nl|> Enjoy the kingdom after my decease. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> What wrong is this unto the prince your son! <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> What good is this to England and himself! <|nl|>  <|nl|> WESTMORELAND: <|nl|> Base, fearful and despairing Henry! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> How hast thou injured both thyself and us! <|nl|>  <|nl|> WESTMORELAND: <|nl|> I cannot stay to hear these articles. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Nor I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WESTMORELAND: <|nl|> Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king, <|nl|> In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Be thou a prey unto the house of York, <|nl|> And die in bands for this unmanly deed! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome, <|nl|> Or live in peace abandon'd and despised! <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> They seek revenge and therefore will not yield. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Ah, Exeter! <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Why should you sigh, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son, <|nl|> Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit. <|nl|> But be it as it may: I here entail <|nl|> The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever; <|nl|> Conditionally, that here thou take an oath <|nl|> To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live, <|nl|> To honour me as thy king and sovereign, <|nl|> And neither by treason nor hostility <|nl|> To seek to put me down and reign thyself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> This oath I willingly take and will perform. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> And long live thou and these thy forward sons! <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Now York and Lancaster are reconciled. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes! <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> And I'll keep London with my soldiers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORFOLK: <|nl|> And I to Norfolk with my followers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> And I unto the sea from whence I came. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger: <|nl|> I'll steal away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Exeter, so will I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Who can be patient in such extremes? <|nl|> Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid <|nl|> And never seen thee, never borne thee son, <|nl|> Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father <|nl|> Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus? <|nl|> Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I, <|nl|> Or felt that pain which I did for him once, <|nl|> Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood, <|nl|> Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there, <|nl|> Rather than have that savage duke thine heir <|nl|> And disinherited thine only son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Father, you cannot disinherit me: <|nl|> If you be king, why should not I succeed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son: <|nl|> The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced? <|nl|> I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch! <|nl|> Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me; <|nl|> And given unto the house of York such head <|nl|> As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance. <|nl|> To entail him and his heirs unto the crown, <|nl|> What is it, but to make thy sepulchre <|nl|> And creep into it far before thy time? <|nl|> Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais; <|nl|> Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas; <|nl|> The duke is made protector of the realm; <|nl|> And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds <|nl|> The trembling lamb environed with wolves. <|nl|> Had I been there, which am a silly woman, <|nl|> The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes <|nl|> Before I would have granted to that act. <|nl|> But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour: <|nl|> And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself <|nl|> Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed, <|nl|> Until that act of parliament be repeal'd <|nl|> Whereby my son is disinherited. <|nl|> The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours <|nl|> Will follow mine, if once they see them spread; <|nl|> And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace <|nl|> And utter ruin of the house of York. <|nl|> Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away; <|nl|> Our army is ready; come, we'll after them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> When I return with victory from the field <|nl|> I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Come, son, away; we may not linger thus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Poor queen! how love to me and to her son <|nl|> Hath made her break out into terms of rage! <|nl|> Revenged may she be on that hateful duke, <|nl|> Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire, <|nl|> Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle <|nl|> Tire on the flesh of me and of my son! <|nl|> The loss of those three lords torments my heart: <|nl|> I'll write unto them and entreat them fair. <|nl|> Come, cousin you shall be the messenger. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> No, I can better play the orator. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> But I have reasons strong and forcible. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife? <|nl|> What is your quarrel? how began it first? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> No quarrel, but a slight contention. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> About what? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> About that which concerns your grace and us; <|nl|> The crown of England, father, which is yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Your right depends not on his life or death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now: <|nl|> By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe, <|nl|> It will outrun you, father, in the end. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> I took an oath that he should quietly reign. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> But for a kingdom any oath may be broken: <|nl|> I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> I shall be, if I claim by open war. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Thou canst not, son; it is impossible. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> An oath is of no moment, being not took <|nl|> Before a true and lawful magistrate, <|nl|> That hath authority over him that swears: <|nl|> Henry had none, but did usurp the place; <|nl|> Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose, <|nl|> Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous. <|nl|> Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think <|nl|> How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown; <|nl|> Within whose circuit is Elysium <|nl|> And all that poets feign of bliss and joy. <|nl|> Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest <|nl|> Until the white rose that I wear be dyed <|nl|> Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Richard, enough; I will be king, or die. <|nl|> Brother, thou shalt to London presently, <|nl|> And whet on Warwick to this enterprise. <|nl|> Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk, <|nl|> And tell him privily of our intent. <|nl|> You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham, <|nl|> With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise: <|nl|> In them I trust; for they are soldiers, <|nl|> Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit. <|nl|> While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more, <|nl|> But that I seek occasion how to rise, <|nl|> And yet the king not privy to my drift, <|nl|> Nor any of the house of Lancaster? <|nl|> But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> The queen with all the northern earls and lords <|nl|> Intend here to besiege you in your castle: <|nl|> She is hard by with twenty thousand men; <|nl|> And therefore fortify your hold, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them? <|nl|> Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me; <|nl|> My brother Montague shall post to London: <|nl|> Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest, <|nl|> Whom we have left protectors of the king, <|nl|> With powerful policy strengthen themselves, <|nl|> And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not: <|nl|> And thus most humbly I do take my leave. <|nl|> Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles, <|nl|> You are come to Sandal in a happy hour; <|nl|> The army of the queen mean to besiege us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOHN MORTIMER: <|nl|> She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> What, with five thousand men? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need: <|nl|> A woman's general; what should we fear? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> I hear their drums: let's set our men in order, <|nl|> And issue forth and bid them battle straight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Five men to twenty! though the odds be great, <|nl|> I doubt not, uncle, of our victory. <|nl|> Many a battle have I won in France, <|nl|> When as the enemy hath been ten to one: <|nl|> Why should I not now have the like success? <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> RUTLAND: <|nl|> Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands? <|nl|> Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life. <|nl|> As for the brat of this accursed duke, <|nl|> Whose father slew my father, he shall die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tutor: <|nl|> And I, my lord, will bear him company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Soldiers, away with him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tutor: <|nl|> Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child, <|nl|> Lest thou be hated both of God and man! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> How now! is he dead already? or is it fear <|nl|> That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RUTLAND: <|nl|> So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch <|nl|> That trembles under his devouring paws; <|nl|> And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey, <|nl|> And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder. <|nl|> Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword, <|nl|> And not with such a cruel threatening look. <|nl|> Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die. <|nl|> I am too mean a subject for thy wrath: <|nl|> Be thou revenged on men, and let me live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood <|nl|> Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RUTLAND: <|nl|> Then let my father's blood open it again: <|nl|> He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine <|nl|> Were not revenge sufficient for me; <|nl|> No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves <|nl|> And hung their rotten coffins up in chains, <|nl|> It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart. <|nl|> The sight of any of the house of York <|nl|> Is as a fury to torment my soul; <|nl|> And till I root out their accursed line <|nl|> And leave not one alive, I live in hell. <|nl|> Therefore-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> RUTLAND: <|nl|> O, let me pray before I take my death! <|nl|> To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Such pity as my rapier's point affords. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RUTLAND: <|nl|> I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Thy father hath. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RUTLAND: <|nl|> But 'twas ere I was born. <|nl|> Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me, <|nl|> Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just, <|nl|> He be as miserably slain as I. <|nl|> Ah, let me live in prison all my days; <|nl|> And when I give occasion of offence, <|nl|> Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> No cause! <|nl|> Thy father slew my father; therefore, die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RUTLAND: <|nl|> Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet! <|nl|> And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade <|nl|> Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood, <|nl|> Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> The army of the queen hath got the field: <|nl|> My uncles both are slain in rescuing me; <|nl|> And all my followers to the eager foe <|nl|> Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind <|nl|> Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves. <|nl|> My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them: <|nl|> But this I know, they have demean'd themselves <|nl|> Like men born to renown by life or death. <|nl|> Three times did Richard make a lane to me. <|nl|> And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!' <|nl|> And full as oft came Edward to my side, <|nl|> With purple falchion, painted to the hilt <|nl|> In blood of those that had encounter'd him: <|nl|> And when the hardiest warriors did retire, <|nl|> Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!' <|nl|> And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb! <|nl|> A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!' <|nl|> With this, we charged again: but, out, alas! <|nl|> We bodged again; as I have seen a swan <|nl|> With bootless labour swim against the tide <|nl|> And spend her strength with over-matching waves. <|nl|> Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue; <|nl|> And I am faint and cannot fly their fury: <|nl|> And were I strong, I would not shun their fury: <|nl|> The sands are number'd that make up my life; <|nl|> Here must I stay, and here my life must end. <|nl|> Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland, <|nl|> I dare your quenchless fury to more rage: <|nl|> I am your butt, and I abide your shot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm, <|nl|> With downright payment, show'd unto my father. <|nl|> Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car, <|nl|> And made an evening at the noontide prick. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth <|nl|> A bird that will revenge upon you all: <|nl|> And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven, <|nl|> Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with. <|nl|> Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> So cowards fight when they can fly no further; <|nl|> So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons; <|nl|> So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives, <|nl|> Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> O Clifford, but bethink thee once again, <|nl|> And in thy thought o'er-run my former time; <|nl|> And, if though canst for blushing, view this face, <|nl|> And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice <|nl|> Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> I will not bandy with thee word for word, <|nl|> But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes <|nl|> I would prolong awhile the traitor's life. <|nl|> Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much <|nl|> To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart: <|nl|> What valour were it, when a cur doth grin, <|nl|> For one to thrust his hand between his teeth, <|nl|> When he might spurn him with his foot away? <|nl|> It is war's prize to take all vantages; <|nl|> And ten to one is no impeach of valour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> So doth the cony struggle in the net. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty; <|nl|> So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> What would your grace have done unto him now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland, <|nl|> Come, make him stand upon this molehill here, <|nl|> That raught at mountains with outstretched arms, <|nl|> Yet parted but the shadow with his hand. <|nl|> What! was it you that would be England's king? <|nl|> Was't you that revell'd in our parliament, <|nl|> And made a preachment of your high descent? <|nl|> Where are your mess of sons to back you now? <|nl|> The wanton Edward, and the lusty George? <|nl|> And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy, <|nl|> Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice <|nl|> Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies? <|nl|> Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland? <|nl|> Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood <|nl|> That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point, <|nl|> Made issue from the bosom of the boy; <|nl|> And if thine eyes can water for his death, <|nl|> I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal. <|nl|> Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly, <|nl|> I should lament thy miserable state. <|nl|> I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York. <|nl|> What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails <|nl|> That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death? <|nl|> Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad; <|nl|> And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus. <|nl|> Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance. <|nl|> Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport: <|nl|> York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown. <|nl|> A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him: <|nl|> Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on. <|nl|> Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king! <|nl|> Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair, <|nl|> And this is he was his adopted heir. <|nl|> But how is it that great Plantagenet <|nl|> Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath? <|nl|> As I bethink me, you should not be king <|nl|> Till our King Henry had shook hands with death. <|nl|> And will you pale your head in Henry's glory, <|nl|> And rob his temples of the diadem, <|nl|> Now in his life, against your holy oath? <|nl|> O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable! <|nl|> Off with the crown, and with the crown his head; <|nl|> And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> That is my office, for my father's sake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France, <|nl|> Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth! <|nl|> How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex <|nl|> To triumph, like an Amazonian trull, <|nl|> Upon their woes whom fortune captivates! <|nl|> But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging, <|nl|> Made impudent with use of evil deeds, <|nl|> I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush. <|nl|> To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived, <|nl|> Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless. <|nl|> Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, <|nl|> Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, <|nl|> Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman. <|nl|> Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult? <|nl|> It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen, <|nl|> Unless the adage must be verified, <|nl|> That beggars mounted run their horse to death. <|nl|> 'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud; <|nl|> But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small: <|nl|> 'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired; <|nl|> The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at: <|nl|> 'Tis government that makes them seem divine; <|nl|> The want thereof makes thee abominable: <|nl|> Thou art as opposite to every good <|nl|> As the Antipodes are unto us, <|nl|> Or as the south to the septentrion. <|nl|> O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide! <|nl|> How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child, <|nl|> To bid the father wipe his eyes withal, <|nl|> And yet be seen to bear a woman's face? <|nl|> Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible; <|nl|> Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless. <|nl|> Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish: <|nl|> Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will: <|nl|> For raging wind blows up incessant showers, <|nl|> And when the rage allays, the rain begins. <|nl|> These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies: <|nl|> And every drop cries vengeance for his death, <|nl|> 'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false <|nl|> Frenchwoman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so <|nl|> That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> That face of his the hungry cannibals <|nl|> Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood: <|nl|> But you are more inhuman, more inexorable, <|nl|> O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania. <|nl|> See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears: <|nl|> This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy, <|nl|> And I with tears do wash the blood away. <|nl|> Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this: <|nl|> And if thou tell'st the heavy story right, <|nl|> Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears; <|nl|> Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears, <|nl|> And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!' <|nl|> There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse; <|nl|> And in thy need such comfort come to thee <|nl|> As now I reap at thy too cruel hand! <|nl|> Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world: <|nl|> My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads! <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin, <|nl|> I should not for my life but weep with him. <|nl|> To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland? <|nl|> Think but upon the wrong he did us all, <|nl|> And that will quickly dry thy melting tears. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> And here's to right our gentle-hearted king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> YORK: <|nl|> Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God! <|nl|> My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Off with his head, and set it on York gates; <|nl|> So York may overlook the town of York. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> I wonder how our princely father 'scaped, <|nl|> Or whether he be 'scaped away or no <|nl|> From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit: <|nl|> Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news; <|nl|> Had he been slain, we should have heard the news; <|nl|> Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard <|nl|> The happy tidings of his good escape. <|nl|> How fares my brother? why is he so sad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> I cannot joy, until I be resolved <|nl|> Where our right valiant father is become. <|nl|> I saw him in the battle range about; <|nl|> And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth. <|nl|> Methought he bore him in the thickest troop <|nl|> As doth a lion in a herd of neat; <|nl|> Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs, <|nl|> Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry, <|nl|> The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him. <|nl|> So fared our father with his enemies; <|nl|> So fled his enemies my warlike father: <|nl|> Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son. <|nl|> See how the morning opes her golden gates, <|nl|> And takes her farewell of the glorious sun! <|nl|> How well resembles it the prime of youth, <|nl|> Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love! <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun; <|nl|> Not separated with the racking clouds, <|nl|> But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky. <|nl|> See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss, <|nl|> As if they vow'd some league inviolable: <|nl|> Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun. <|nl|> In this the heaven figures some event. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of. <|nl|> I think it cites us, brother, to the field, <|nl|> That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet, <|nl|> Each one already blazing by our meeds, <|nl|> Should notwithstanding join our lights together <|nl|> And over-shine the earth as this the world. <|nl|> Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear <|nl|> Upon my target three fair-shining suns. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it, <|nl|> You love the breeder better than the male. <|nl|> But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell <|nl|> Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Ah, one that was a woful looker-on <|nl|> When as the noble Duke of York was slain, <|nl|> Your princely father and my loving lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> O, speak no more, for I have heard too much. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Say how he died, for I will hear it all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Environed he was with many foes, <|nl|> And stood against them, as the hope of Troy <|nl|> Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy. <|nl|> But Hercules himself must yield to odds; <|nl|> And many strokes, though with a little axe, <|nl|> Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak. <|nl|> By many hands your father was subdued; <|nl|> But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm <|nl|> Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen, <|nl|> Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite, <|nl|> Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept, <|nl|> The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks <|nl|> A napkin steeped in the harmless blood <|nl|> Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain: <|nl|> And after many scorns, many foul taunts, <|nl|> They took his head, and on the gates of York <|nl|> They set the same; and there it doth remain, <|nl|> The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon, <|nl|> Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay. <|nl|> O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain <|nl|> The flower of Europe for his chivalry; <|nl|> And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him, <|nl|> For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee. <|nl|> Now my soul's palace is become a prison: <|nl|> Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body <|nl|> Might in the ground be closed up in rest! <|nl|> For never henceforth shall I joy again, <|nl|> Never, O never shall I see more joy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture <|nl|> Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart: <|nl|> Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen; <|nl|> For selfsame wind that I should speak withal <|nl|> Is kindling coals that fires all my breast, <|nl|> And burns me up with flames that tears would quench. <|nl|> To weep is to make less the depth of grief: <|nl|> Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me <|nl|> Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death, <|nl|> Or die renowned by attempting it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> His name that valiant duke hath left with thee; <|nl|> His dukedom and his chair with me is left. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird, <|nl|> Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun: <|nl|> For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say; <|nl|> Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount <|nl|> Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance <|nl|> Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told, <|nl|> The words would add more anguish than the wounds. <|nl|> O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain! <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet, <|nl|> Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption, <|nl|> Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears; <|nl|> And now, to add more measure to your woes, <|nl|> I come to tell you things sith then befall'n. <|nl|> After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought, <|nl|> Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp, <|nl|> Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, <|nl|> Were brought me of your loss and his depart. <|nl|> I, then in London keeper of the king, <|nl|> Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends, <|nl|> And very well appointed, as I thought, <|nl|> March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen, <|nl|> Bearing the king in my behalf along; <|nl|> For by my scouts I was advertised <|nl|> That she was coming with a full intent <|nl|> To dash our late decree in parliament <|nl|> Touching King Henry's oath and your succession. <|nl|> Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met <|nl|> Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought: <|nl|> But whether 'twas the coldness of the king, <|nl|> Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen, <|nl|> That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen; <|nl|> Or whether 'twas report of her success; <|nl|> Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour, <|nl|> Who thunders to his captives blood and death, <|nl|> I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth, <|nl|> Their weapons like to lightning came and went; <|nl|> Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight, <|nl|> Or like an idle thresher with a flail, <|nl|> Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends. <|nl|> I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause, <|nl|> With promise of high pay and great rewards: <|nl|> But all in vain; they had no heart to fight, <|nl|> And we in them no hope to win the day; <|nl|> So that we fled; the king unto the queen; <|nl|> Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself, <|nl|> In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you: <|nl|> For in the marches here we heard you were, <|nl|> Making another head to fight again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick? <|nl|> And when came George from Burgundy to England? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers; <|nl|> And for your brother, he was lately sent <|nl|> From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy, <|nl|> With aid of soldiers to this needful war. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled: <|nl|> Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit, <|nl|> But ne'er till now his scandal of retire. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear; <|nl|> For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine <|nl|> Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head, <|nl|> And wring the awful sceptre from his fist, <|nl|> Were he as famous and as bold in war <|nl|> As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not: <|nl|> 'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak. <|nl|> But in this troublous time what's to be done? <|nl|> Shall we go throw away our coats of steel, <|nl|> And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns, <|nl|> Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads? <|nl|> Or shall we on the helmets of our foes <|nl|> Tell our devotion with revengeful arms? <|nl|> If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out; <|nl|> And therefore comes my brother Montague. <|nl|> Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen, <|nl|> With Clifford and the haught Northumberland, <|nl|> And of their feather many more proud birds, <|nl|> Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax. <|nl|> He swore consent to your succession, <|nl|> His oath enrolled in the parliament; <|nl|> And now to London all the crew are gone, <|nl|> To frustrate both his oath and what beside <|nl|> May make against the house of Lancaster. <|nl|> Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong: <|nl|> Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself, <|nl|> With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March, <|nl|> Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure, <|nl|> Will but amount to five and twenty thousand, <|nl|> Why, Via! to London will we march amain, <|nl|> And once again bestride our foaming steeds, <|nl|> And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!' <|nl|> But never once again turn back and fly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak: <|nl|> Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day, <|nl|> That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean; <|nl|> And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!-- <|nl|> Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend! <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York: <|nl|> The next degree is England's royal throne; <|nl|> For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd <|nl|> In every borough as we pass along; <|nl|> And he that throws not up his cap for joy <|nl|> Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head. <|nl|> King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague, <|nl|> Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown, <|nl|> But sound the trumpets, and about our task. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel, <|nl|> As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds, <|nl|> I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us! <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> How now! what news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me, <|nl|> The queen is coming with a puissant host; <|nl|> And craves your company for speedy counsel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York. <|nl|> Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy <|nl|> That sought to be encompass'd with your crown: <|nl|> Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck: <|nl|> To see this sight, it irks my very soul. <|nl|> Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault, <|nl|> Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> My gracious liege, this too much lenity <|nl|> And harmful pity must be laid aside. <|nl|> To whom do lions cast their gentle looks? <|nl|> Not to the beast that would usurp their den. <|nl|> Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick? <|nl|> Not his that spoils her young before her face. <|nl|> Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting? <|nl|> Not he that sets his foot upon her back. <|nl|> The smallest worm will turn being trodden on, <|nl|> And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood. <|nl|> Ambitious York doth level at thy crown, <|nl|> Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows: <|nl|> He, but a duke, would have his son a king, <|nl|> And raise his issue, like a loving sire; <|nl|> Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son, <|nl|> Didst yield consent to disinherit him, <|nl|> Which argued thee a most unloving father. <|nl|> Unreasonable creatures feed their young; <|nl|> And though man's face be fearful to their eyes, <|nl|> Yet, in protection of their tender ones, <|nl|> Who hath not seen them, even with those wings <|nl|> Which sometime they have used with fearful flight, <|nl|> Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest, <|nl|> Offer their own lives in their young's defence? <|nl|> For shame, my liege, make them your precedent! <|nl|> Were it not pity that this goodly boy <|nl|> Should lose his birthright by his father's fault, <|nl|> And long hereafter say unto his child, <|nl|> 'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got <|nl|> My careless father fondly gave away'? <|nl|> Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy; <|nl|> And let his manly face, which promiseth <|nl|> Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart <|nl|> To hold thine own and leave thine own with him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator, <|nl|> Inferring arguments of mighty force. <|nl|> But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear <|nl|> That things ill-got had ever bad success? <|nl|> And happy always was it for that son <|nl|> Whose father for his hoarding went to hell? <|nl|> I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind; <|nl|> And would my father had left me no more! <|nl|> For all the rest is held at such a rate <|nl|> As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep <|nl|> Than in possession and jot of pleasure. <|nl|> Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know <|nl|> How it doth grieve me that thy head is here! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh, <|nl|> And this soft courage makes your followers faint. <|nl|> You promised knighthood to our forward son: <|nl|> Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently. <|nl|> Edward, kneel down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight; <|nl|> And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE: <|nl|> My gracious father, by your kingly leave, <|nl|> I'll draw it as apparent to the crown, <|nl|> And in that quarrel use it to the death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Why, that is spoken like a toward prince. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Royal commanders, be in readiness: <|nl|> For with a band of thirty thousand men <|nl|> Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York; <|nl|> And in the towns, as they do march along, <|nl|> Proclaims him king, and many fly to him: <|nl|> Darraign your battle, for they are at hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> I would your highness would depart the field: <|nl|> The queen hath best success when you are absent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> Be it with resolution then to fight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> My royal father, cheer these noble lords <|nl|> And hearten those that fight in your defence: <|nl|> Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!' <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace, <|nl|> And set thy diadem upon my head; <|nl|> Or bide the mortal fortune of the field? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy! <|nl|> Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms <|nl|> Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> I am his king, and he should bow his knee; <|nl|> I was adopted heir by his consent: <|nl|> Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear, <|nl|> You, that are king, though he do wear the crown, <|nl|> Have caused him, by new act of parliament, <|nl|> To blot out me, and put his own son in. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> And reason too: <|nl|> Who should succeed the father but the son? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee, <|nl|> Or any he the proudest of thy sort. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak? <|nl|> When you and I met at Saint Alban's last, <|nl|> Your legs did better service than your hands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> You said so much before, and yet you fled. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NORTHUMBERLAND: <|nl|> No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Northumberland, I hold thee reverently. <|nl|> Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain <|nl|> The execution of my big-swoln heart <|nl|> Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward, <|nl|> As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland; <|nl|> But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> I prithee, give no limits to my tongue: <|nl|> I am a king, and privileged to speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here <|nl|> Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword: <|nl|> By him that made us all, I am resolved <|nl|> that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no? <|nl|> A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day, <|nl|> That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> If thou deny, their blood upon thy head; <|nl|> For York in justice puts his armour on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> If that be right which Warwick says is right, <|nl|> There is no wrong, but every thing is right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands; <|nl|> For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam; <|nl|> But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic, <|nl|> Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided, <|nl|> As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Iron of Naples hid with English gilt, <|nl|> Whose father bears the title of a king,-- <|nl|> As if a channel should be call'd the sea,-- <|nl|> Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught, <|nl|> To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns, <|nl|> To make this shameless callet know herself. <|nl|> Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou, <|nl|> Although thy husband may be Menelaus; <|nl|> And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd <|nl|> By that false woman, as this king by thee. <|nl|> His father revell'd in the heart of France, <|nl|> And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop; <|nl|> And had he match'd according to his state, <|nl|> He might have kept that glory to this day; <|nl|> But when he took a beggar to his bed, <|nl|> And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day, <|nl|> Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him, <|nl|> That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France, <|nl|> And heap'd sedition on his crown at home. <|nl|> For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride? <|nl|> Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept; <|nl|> And we, in pity of the gentle king, <|nl|> Had slipp'd our claim until another age. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GEORGE: <|nl|> But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring, <|nl|> And that thy summer bred us no increase, <|nl|> We set the axe to thy usurping root; <|nl|> And though the edge hath something hit ourselves, <|nl|> Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike, <|nl|> We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down, <|nl|> Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> And, in this resolution, I defy thee; <|nl|> Not willing any longer conference, <|nl|> Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak. <|nl|> Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave! <|nl|> And either victory, or else a grave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Stay, Edward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay: <|nl|> These words will cost ten thousand lives this day. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Forspent with toil, as runners with a race, <|nl|> I lay me down a little while to breathe; <|nl|> For strokes received, and many blows repaid, <|nl|> Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength, <|nl|> And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death! <|nl|> For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GEORGE: <|nl|> Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair; <|nl|> Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us: <|nl|> What counsel give you? whither shall we fly? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings; <|nl|> And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself? <|nl|> Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk, <|nl|> Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance; <|nl|> And in the very pangs of death he cried, <|nl|> Like to a dismal clangour heard from far, <|nl|> 'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!' <|nl|> So, underneath the belly of their steeds, <|nl|> That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood, <|nl|> The noble gentleman gave up the ghost. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Then let the earth be drunken with our blood: <|nl|> I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly. <|nl|> Why stand we like soft-hearted women here, <|nl|> Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage; <|nl|> And look upon, as if the tragedy <|nl|> Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors? <|nl|> Here on my knee I vow to God above, <|nl|> I'll never pause again, never stand still, <|nl|> Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine <|nl|> Or fortune given me measure of revenge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine; <|nl|> And in this vow do chain my soul to thine! <|nl|> And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face, <|nl|> I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee, <|nl|> Thou setter up and plucker down of kings, <|nl|> Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands <|nl|> That to my foes this body must be prey, <|nl|> Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope, <|nl|> And give sweet passage to my sinful soul! <|nl|> Now, lords, take leave until we meet again, <|nl|> Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick, <|nl|> Let me embrace thee in my weary arms: <|nl|> I, that did never weep, now melt with woe <|nl|> That winter should cut off our spring-time so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GEORGE: <|nl|> Yet let us all together to our troops, <|nl|> And give them leave to fly that will not stay; <|nl|> And call them pillars that will stand to us; <|nl|> And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards <|nl|> As victors wear at the Olympian games: <|nl|> This may plant courage in their quailing breasts; <|nl|> For yet is hope of life and victory. <|nl|> Forslow no longer, make we hence amain. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone: <|nl|> Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York, <|nl|> And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge, <|nl|> Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone: <|nl|> This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York; <|nl|> And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland; <|nl|> And here's the heart that triumphs in their death <|nl|> And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother <|nl|> To execute the like upon thyself; <|nl|> And so, have at thee! <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Nay Warwick, single out some other chase; <|nl|> For I myself will hunt this wolf to death. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> This battle fares like to the morning's war, <|nl|> When dying clouds contend with growing light, <|nl|> What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails, <|nl|> Can neither call it perfect day nor night. <|nl|> Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea <|nl|> Forced by the tide to combat with the wind; <|nl|> Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea <|nl|> Forced to retire by fury of the wind: <|nl|> Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind; <|nl|> Now one the better, then another best; <|nl|> Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast, <|nl|> Yet neither conqueror nor conquered: <|nl|> So is the equal of this fell war. <|nl|> Here on this molehill will I sit me down. <|nl|> To whom God will, there be the victory! <|nl|> For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too, <|nl|> Have chid me from the battle; swearing both <|nl|> They prosper best of all when I am thence. <|nl|> Would I were dead! if God's good will were so; <|nl|> For what is in this world but grief and woe? <|nl|> O God! methinks it were a happy life, <|nl|> To be no better than a homely swain; <|nl|> To sit upon a hill, as I do now, <|nl|> To carve out dials quaintly, point by point, <|nl|> Thereby to see the minutes how they run, <|nl|> How many make the hour full complete; <|nl|> How many hours bring about the day; <|nl|> How many days will finish up the year; <|nl|> How many years a mortal man may live. <|nl|> When this is known, then to divide the times: <|nl|> So many hours must I tend my flock; <|nl|> So many hours must I take my rest; <|nl|> So many hours must I contemplate; <|nl|> So many hours must I sport myself; <|nl|> So many days my ewes have been with young; <|nl|> So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean: <|nl|> So many years ere I shall shear the fleece: <|nl|> So minutes, hours, days, months, and years, <|nl|> Pass'd over to the end they were created, <|nl|> Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave. <|nl|> Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely! <|nl|> Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade <|nl|> To shepherds looking on their silly sheep, <|nl|> Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy <|nl|> To kings that fear their subjects' treachery? <|nl|> O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth. <|nl|> And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds, <|nl|> His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle. <|nl|> His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade, <|nl|> All which secure and sweetly he enjoys, <|nl|> Is far beyond a prince's delicates, <|nl|> His viands sparkling in a golden cup, <|nl|> His body couched in a curious bed, <|nl|> When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Son: <|nl|> Ill blows the wind that profits nobody. <|nl|> This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight, <|nl|> May be possessed with some store of crowns; <|nl|> And I, that haply take them from him now, <|nl|> May yet ere night yield both my life and them <|nl|> To some man else, as this dead man doth me. <|nl|> Who's this? O God! it is my father's face, <|nl|> Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd. <|nl|> O heavy times, begetting such events! <|nl|> From London by the king was I press'd forth; <|nl|> My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man, <|nl|> Came on the part of York, press'd by his master; <|nl|> And I, who at his hands received my life, him <|nl|> Have by my hands of life bereaved him. <|nl|> Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did! <|nl|> And pardon, father, for I knew not thee! <|nl|> My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks; <|nl|> And no more words till they have flow'd their fill. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> O piteous spectacle! O bloody times! <|nl|> Whiles lions war and battle for their dens, <|nl|> Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity. <|nl|> Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear; <|nl|> And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war, <|nl|> Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Father: <|nl|> Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me, <|nl|> Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold: <|nl|> For I have bought it with an hundred blows. <|nl|> But let me see: is this our foeman's face? <|nl|> Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son! <|nl|> Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee, <|nl|> Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise, <|nl|> Blown with the windy tempest of my heart, <|nl|> Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart! <|nl|> O, pity, God, this miserable age! <|nl|> What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly, <|nl|> Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural, <|nl|> This deadly quarrel daily doth beget! <|nl|> O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon, <|nl|> And hath bereft thee of thy life too late! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Woe above woe! grief more than common grief! <|nl|> O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds! <|nl|> O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity! <|nl|> The red rose and the white are on his face, <|nl|> The fatal colours of our striving houses: <|nl|> The one his purple blood right well resembles; <|nl|> The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth: <|nl|> Wither one rose, and let the other flourish; <|nl|> If you contend, a thousand lives must wither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Son: <|nl|> How will my mother for a father's death <|nl|> Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Father: <|nl|> How will my wife for slaughter of my son <|nl|> Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> How will the country for these woful chances <|nl|> Misthink the king and not be satisfied! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Son: <|nl|> Was ever son so rued a father's death? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Father: <|nl|> Was ever father so bemoan'd his son? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe? <|nl|> Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Son: <|nl|> I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Father: <|nl|> These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet; <|nl|> My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre, <|nl|> For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go; <|nl|> My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell; <|nl|> And so obsequious will thy father be, <|nl|> Even for the loss of thee, having no more, <|nl|> As Priam was for all his valiant sons. <|nl|> I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will, <|nl|> For I have murdered where I should not kill. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care, <|nl|> Here sits a king more woful than you are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled, <|nl|> And Warwick rages like a chafed bull: <|nl|> Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain: <|nl|> Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds <|nl|> Having the fearful flying hare in sight, <|nl|> With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath, <|nl|> And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands, <|nl|> Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> Away! for vengeance comes along with them: <|nl|> Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed; <|nl|> Or else come after: I'll away before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter: <|nl|> Not that I fear to stay, but love to go <|nl|> Whither the queen intends. Forward; away! <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLIFFORD: <|nl|> Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies, <|nl|> Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light. <|nl|> O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow <|nl|> More than my body's parting with my soul! <|nl|> My love and fear glued many friends to thee; <|nl|> And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts. <|nl|> Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York, <|nl|> The common people swarm like summer flies; <|nl|> And whither fly the gnats but to the sun? <|nl|> And who shines now but Henry's enemies? <|nl|> O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent <|nl|> That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds, <|nl|> Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth! <|nl|> And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do, <|nl|> Or as thy father and his father did, <|nl|> Giving no ground unto the house of York, <|nl|> They never then had sprung like summer flies; <|nl|> I and ten thousand in this luckless realm <|nl|> Had left no mourning widows for our death; <|nl|> And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace. <|nl|> For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air? <|nl|> And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity? <|nl|> Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds; <|nl|> No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight: <|nl|> The foe is merciless, and will not pity; <|nl|> For at their hands I have deserved no pity. <|nl|> The air hath got into my deadly wounds, <|nl|> And much effuse of blood doth make me faint. <|nl|> Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest; <|nl|> I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause, <|nl|> And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks. <|nl|> Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen, <|nl|> That led calm Henry, though he were a king, <|nl|> As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust, <|nl|> Command an argosy to stem the waves. <|nl|> But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> No, 'tis impossible he should escape, <|nl|> For, though before his face I speak the words <|nl|> Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave: <|nl|> And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> A deadly groan, like life and death's departing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> See who it is: and, now the battle's ended, <|nl|> If friend or foe, let him be gently used. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford; <|nl|> Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch <|nl|> In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth, <|nl|> But set his murdering knife unto the root <|nl|> From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring, <|nl|> I mean our princely father, Duke of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> From off the gates of York fetch down the head, <|nl|> Your father's head, which Clifford placed there; <|nl|> Instead whereof let this supply the room: <|nl|> Measure for measure must be answered. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house, <|nl|> That nothing sung but death to us and ours: <|nl|> Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound, <|nl|> And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> I think his understanding is bereft. <|nl|> Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee? <|nl|> Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life, <|nl|> And he nor sees nor hears us what we say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth: <|nl|> 'Tis but his policy to counterfeit, <|nl|> Because he would avoid such bitter taunts <|nl|> Which in the time of death he gave our father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GEORGE: <|nl|> If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Clifford, repent in bootless penitence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GEORGE: <|nl|> While we devise fell tortures for thy faults. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Thou didst love York, and I am son to York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GEORGE: <|nl|> Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard <|nl|> When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath. <|nl|> I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul, <|nl|> If this right hand would buy two hour's life, <|nl|> That I in all despite might rail at him, <|nl|> This hand should chop it off, and with the <|nl|> issuing blood <|nl|> Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst <|nl|> York and young Rutland could not satisfy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head, <|nl|> And rear it in the place your father's stands. <|nl|> And now to London with triumphant march, <|nl|> There to be crowned England's royal king: <|nl|> From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France, <|nl|> And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen: <|nl|> So shalt thou sinew both these lands together; <|nl|> And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread <|nl|> The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again; <|nl|> For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt, <|nl|> Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears. <|nl|> First will I see the coronation; <|nl|> And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea, <|nl|> To effect this marriage, so it please my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be; <|nl|> For in thy shoulder do I build my seat, <|nl|> And never will I undertake the thing <|nl|> Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting. <|nl|> Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester, <|nl|> And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself, <|nl|> Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RICHARD: <|nl|> Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester; <|nl|> For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Tut, that's a foolish observation: <|nl|> Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London, <|nl|> To see these honours in possession. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Keeper: <|nl|> Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves; <|nl|> For through this laund anon the deer will come; <|nl|> And in this covert will we make our stand, <|nl|> Culling the principal of all the deer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Keeper: <|nl|> I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Keeper: <|nl|> That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow <|nl|> Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost. <|nl|> Here stand we both, and aim we at the best: <|nl|> And, for the time shall not seem tedious, <|nl|> I'll tell thee what befell me on a day <|nl|> In this self-place where now we mean to stand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Keeper: <|nl|> Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love, <|nl|> To greet mine own land with my wishful sight. <|nl|> No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine; <|nl|> Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee, <|nl|> Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed: <|nl|> No bending knee will call thee Caesar now, <|nl|> No humble suitors press to speak for right, <|nl|> No, not a man comes for redress of thee; <|nl|> For how can I help them, and not myself? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Keeper: <|nl|> Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee: <|nl|> This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, <|nl|> For wise men say it is the wisest course. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Keeper: <|nl|> Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Keeper: <|nl|> Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> My queen and son are gone to France for aid; <|nl|> And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick <|nl|> Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister <|nl|> To wife for Edward: if this news be true, <|nl|> Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost; <|nl|> For Warwick is a subtle orator, <|nl|> And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words. <|nl|> By this account then Margaret may win him; <|nl|> For she's a woman to be pitied much: <|nl|> Her sighs will make a battery in his breast; <|nl|> Her tears will pierce into a marble heart; <|nl|> The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn; <|nl|> And Nero will be tainted with remorse, <|nl|> To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears. <|nl|> Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give; <|nl|> She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry, <|nl|> He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward. <|nl|> She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed; <|nl|> He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd; <|nl|> That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more; <|nl|> Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong, <|nl|> Inferreth arguments of mighty strength, <|nl|> And in conclusion wins the king from her, <|nl|> With promise of his sister, and what else, <|nl|> To strengthen and support King Edward's place. <|nl|> O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul, <|nl|> Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Keeper: <|nl|> Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> More than I seem, and less than I was born to: <|nl|> A man at least, for less I should not be; <|nl|> And men may talk of kings, and why not I? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Keeper: <|nl|> Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Keeper: <|nl|> But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> My crown is in my heart, not on my head; <|nl|> Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones, <|nl|> Nor to be seen: my crown is called content: <|nl|> A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Keeper: <|nl|> Well, if you be a king crown'd with content, <|nl|> Your crown content and you must be contented <|nl|> To go along with us; for as we think, <|nl|> You are the king King Edward hath deposed; <|nl|> And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance <|nl|> Will apprehend you as his enemy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> But did you never swear, and break an oath? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Keeper: <|nl|> No, never such an oath; nor will not now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Where did you dwell when I was King of England? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Keeper: <|nl|> Here in this country, where we now remain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> I was anointed king at nine months old; <|nl|> My father and my grandfather were kings, <|nl|> And you were sworn true subjects unto me: <|nl|> And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Keeper: <|nl|> No; <|nl|> For we were subjects but while you were king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man? <|nl|> Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear! <|nl|> Look, as I blow this feather from my face, <|nl|> And as the air blows it to me again, <|nl|> Obeying with my wind when I do blow, <|nl|> And yielding to another when it blows, <|nl|> Commanded always by the greater gust; <|nl|> Such is the lightness of you common men. <|nl|> But do not break your oaths; for of that sin <|nl|> My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty. <|nl|> Go where you will, the king shall be commanded; <|nl|> And be you kings, command, and I'll obey. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Keeper: <|nl|> We are true subjects to the king, King Edward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> So would you be again to Henry, <|nl|> If he were seated as King Edward is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Keeper: <|nl|> We charge you, in God's name, and the king's, <|nl|> To go with us unto the officers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd: <|nl|> And what God will, that let your king perform; <|nl|> And what he will, I humbly yield unto. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field <|nl|> This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain, <|nl|> His lands then seized on by the conqueror: <|nl|> Her suit is now to repossess those lands; <|nl|> Which we in justice cannot well deny, <|nl|> Because in quarrel of the house of York <|nl|> The worthy gentleman did lose his life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Your highness shall do well to grant her suit; <|nl|> It were dishonour to deny it her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Widow, we will consider of your suit; <|nl|> And come some other time to know our mind. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay: <|nl|> May it please your highness to resolve me now; <|nl|> And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> How many children hast thou, widow? tell me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Three, my most gracious lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now tell me, madam, do you love your children? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Ay, full as dearly as I love myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> And would you not do much to do them good? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> To do them good, I would sustain some harm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Then get your husband's lands, to do them good. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Therefore I came unto your majesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> I'll tell you how these lands are to be got. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> So shall you bind me to your highness' service. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> What service wilt thou do me, if I give them? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> What you command, that rests in me to do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> But you will take exceptions to my boon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Why, then I will do what your grace commands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> An easy task; 'tis but to love a king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> I take my leave with many thousand thanks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense. <|nl|> What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers; <|nl|> That love which virtue begs and virtue grants. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> No, by my troth, I did not mean such love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Why, then you mean not as I thought you did. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> But now you partly may perceive my mind. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> My mind will never grant what I perceive <|nl|> Your highness aims at, if I aim aright. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower; <|nl|> For by that loss I will not purchase them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Herein your highness wrongs both them and me. <|nl|> But, mighty lord, this merry inclination <|nl|> Accords not with the sadness of my suit: <|nl|> Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request; <|nl|> No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> 'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord: <|nl|> I am a subject fit to jest withal, <|nl|> But far unfit to be a sovereign. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee <|nl|> I speak no more than what my soul intends; <|nl|> And that is, to enjoy thee for my love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> And that is more than I will yield unto: <|nl|> I know I am too mean to be your queen, <|nl|> And yet too good to be your concubine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LADY GREY: <|nl|> 'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> No more than when my daughters call thee mother. <|nl|> Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children; <|nl|> And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor, <|nl|> Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing <|nl|> To be the father unto many sons. <|nl|> Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> You'll think it strange if I should marry her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> To whom, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Why, Clarence, to myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> That would be ten days' wonder at the least. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> That's a day longer than a wonder lasts. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> By so much is the wonder in extremes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both <|nl|> Her suit is granted for her husband's lands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Nobleman: <|nl|> My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken, <|nl|> And brought your prisoner to your palace gate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> See that he be convey'd unto the Tower: <|nl|> And go we, brothers, to the man that took him, <|nl|> To question of his apprehension. <|nl|> Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Ay, Edward will use women honourably. <|nl|> Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all, <|nl|> That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring, <|nl|> To cross me from the golden time I look for! <|nl|> And yet, between my soul's desire and me-- <|nl|> The lustful Edward's title buried-- <|nl|> Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward, <|nl|> And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies, <|nl|> To take their rooms, ere I can place myself: <|nl|> A cold premeditation for my purpose! <|nl|> Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty; <|nl|> Like one that stands upon a promontory, <|nl|> And spies a far-off shore where he would tread, <|nl|> Wishing his foot were equal with his eye, <|nl|> And chides the sea that sunders him from thence, <|nl|> Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way: <|nl|> So do I wish the crown, being so far off; <|nl|> And so I chide the means that keeps me from it; <|nl|> And so I say, I'll cut the causes off, <|nl|> Flattering me with impossibilities. <|nl|> My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much, <|nl|> Unless my hand and strength could equal them. <|nl|> Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard; <|nl|> What other pleasure can the world afford? <|nl|> I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap, <|nl|> And deck my body in gay ornaments, <|nl|> And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks. <|nl|> O miserable thought! and more unlikely <|nl|> Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns! <|nl|> Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb: <|nl|> And, for I should not deal in her soft laws, <|nl|> She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe, <|nl|> To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub; <|nl|> To make an envious mountain on my back, <|nl|> Where sits deformity to mock my body; <|nl|> To shape my legs of an unequal size; <|nl|> To disproportion me in every part, <|nl|> Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp <|nl|> That carries no impression like the dam. <|nl|> And am I then a man to be beloved? <|nl|> O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought! <|nl|> Then, since this earth affords no joy to me, <|nl|> But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such <|nl|> As are of better person than myself, <|nl|> I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown, <|nl|> And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell, <|nl|> Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head <|nl|> Be round impaled with a glorious crown. <|nl|> And yet I know not how to get the crown, <|nl|> For many lives stand between me and home: <|nl|> And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood, <|nl|> That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns, <|nl|> Seeking a way and straying from the way; <|nl|> Not knowing how to find the open air, <|nl|> But toiling desperately to find it out,-- <|nl|> Torment myself to catch the English crown: <|nl|> And from that torment I will free myself, <|nl|> Or hew my way out with a bloody axe. <|nl|> Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile, <|nl|> And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart, <|nl|> And wet my cheeks with artificial tears, <|nl|> And frame my face to all occasions. <|nl|> I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall; <|nl|> I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk; <|nl|> I'll play the orator as well as Nestor, <|nl|> Deceive more slily than Ulysses could, <|nl|> And, like a Sinon, take another Troy. <|nl|> I can add colours to the chameleon, <|nl|> Change shapes with Proteus for advantages, <|nl|> And set the murderous Machiavel to school. <|nl|> Can I do this, and cannot get a crown? <|nl|> Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret, <|nl|> Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state <|nl|> And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> No, mighty King of France: now Margaret <|nl|> Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve <|nl|> Where kings command. I was, I must confess, <|nl|> Great Albion's queen in former golden days: <|nl|> But now mischance hath trod my title down, <|nl|> And with dishonour laid me on the ground; <|nl|> Where I must take like seat unto my fortune, <|nl|> And to my humble seat conform myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears <|nl|> And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself, <|nl|> And sit thee by our side: <|nl|> Yield not thy neck <|nl|> To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind <|nl|> Still ride in triumph over all mischance. <|nl|> Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief; <|nl|> It shall be eased, if France can yield relief. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts <|nl|> And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak. <|nl|> Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis, <|nl|> That Henry, sole possessor of my love, <|nl|> Is of a king become a banish'd man, <|nl|> And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn; <|nl|> While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York <|nl|> Usurps the regal title and the seat <|nl|> Of England's true-anointed lawful king. <|nl|> This is the cause that I, poor Margaret, <|nl|> With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir, <|nl|> Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid; <|nl|> And if thou fail us, all our hope is done: <|nl|> Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help; <|nl|> Our people and our peers are both misled, <|nl|> Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight, <|nl|> And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm, <|nl|> While we bethink a means to break it off. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow. <|nl|> And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> What's he approacheth boldly to our presence? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Ay, now begins a second storm to rise; <|nl|> For this is he that moves both wind and tide. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> From worthy Edward, King of Albion, <|nl|> My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend, <|nl|> I come, in kindness and unfeigned love, <|nl|> First, to do greetings to thy royal person; <|nl|> And then to crave a league of amity; <|nl|> And lastly, to confirm that amity <|nl|> With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant <|nl|> That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister, <|nl|> To England's king in lawful marriage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak, <|nl|> Before you answer Warwick. His demand <|nl|> Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love, <|nl|> But from deceit bred by necessity; <|nl|> For how can tyrants safely govern home, <|nl|> Unless abroad they purchase great alliance? <|nl|> To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice, <|nl|> That Henry liveth still: but were he dead, <|nl|> Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son. <|nl|> Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage <|nl|> Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour; <|nl|> For though usurpers sway the rule awhile, <|nl|> Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Injurious Margaret! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> And why not queen? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Because thy father Henry did usurp; <|nl|> And thou no more are prince than she is queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt, <|nl|> Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain; <|nl|> And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth, <|nl|> Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest; <|nl|> And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth, <|nl|> Who by his prowess conquered all France: <|nl|> From these our Henry lineally descends. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse, <|nl|> You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost <|nl|> All that which Henry Fifth had gotten? <|nl|> Methinks these peers of France should smile at that. <|nl|> But for the rest, you tell a pedigree <|nl|> Of threescore and two years; a silly time <|nl|> To make prescription for a kingdom's worth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege, <|nl|> Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years, <|nl|> And not bewray thy treason with a blush? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right, <|nl|> Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree? <|nl|> For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> Call him my king by whose injurious doom <|nl|> My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere, <|nl|> Was done to death? and more than so, my father, <|nl|> Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years, <|nl|> When nature brought him to the door of death? <|nl|> No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm, <|nl|> This arm upholds the house of Lancaster. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> And I the house of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford, <|nl|> Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside, <|nl|> While I use further conference with Warwick. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience, <|nl|> Is Edward your true king? for I were loath <|nl|> To link with him that were not lawful chosen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> But is he gracious in the people's eye? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> The more that Henry was unfortunate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Then further, all dissembling set aside, <|nl|> Tell me for truth the measure of his love <|nl|> Unto our sister Bona. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Such it seems <|nl|> As may beseem a monarch like himself. <|nl|> Myself have often heard him say and swear <|nl|> That this his love was an eternal plant, <|nl|> Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground, <|nl|> The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun, <|nl|> Exempt from envy, but not from disdain, <|nl|> Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BONA: <|nl|> Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine: <|nl|> Yet I confess that often ere this day, <|nl|> When I have heard your king's desert recounted, <|nl|> Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's; <|nl|> And now forthwith shall articles be drawn <|nl|> Touching the jointure that your king must make, <|nl|> Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised. <|nl|> Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness <|nl|> That Bona shall be wife to the English king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> To Edward, but not to the English king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device <|nl|> By this alliance to make void my suit: <|nl|> Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> And still is friend to him and Margaret: <|nl|> But if your title to the crown be weak, <|nl|> As may appear by Edward's good success, <|nl|> Then 'tis but reason that I be released <|nl|> From giving aid which late I promised. <|nl|> Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand <|nl|> That your estate requires and mine can yield. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease, <|nl|> Where having nothing, nothing can he lose. <|nl|> And as for you yourself, our quondam queen, <|nl|> You have a father able to maintain you; <|nl|> And better 'twere you troubled him than France. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace, <|nl|> Proud setter up and puller down of kings! <|nl|> I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears, <|nl|> Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold <|nl|> Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love; <|nl|> For both of you are birds of selfsame feather. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Warwick, this is some post to us or thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Post: <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> I like it well that our fair queen and mistress <|nl|> Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled: <|nl|> I hope all's for the best. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> What! has your king married the Lady Grey! <|nl|> And now, to soothe your forgery and his, <|nl|> Sends me a paper to persuade me patience? <|nl|> Is this the alliance that he seeks with France? <|nl|> Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> I told your majesty as much before: <|nl|> This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven, <|nl|> And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss, <|nl|> That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's, <|nl|> No more my king, for he dishonours me, <|nl|> But most himself, if he could see his shame. <|nl|> Did I forget that by the house of York <|nl|> My father came untimely to his death? <|nl|> Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece? <|nl|> Did I impale him with the regal crown? <|nl|> Did I put Henry from his native right? <|nl|> And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame? <|nl|> Shame on himself! for my desert is honour: <|nl|> And to repair my honour lost for him, <|nl|> I here renounce him and return to Henry. <|nl|> My noble queen, let former grudges pass, <|nl|> And henceforth I am thy true servitor: <|nl|> I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona, <|nl|> And replant Henry in his former state. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love; <|nl|> And I forgive and quite forget old faults, <|nl|> And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend, <|nl|> That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us <|nl|> With some few bands of chosen soldiers, <|nl|> I'll undertake to land them on our coast <|nl|> And force the tyrant from his seat by war. <|nl|> 'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him: <|nl|> And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me, <|nl|> He's very likely now to fall from him, <|nl|> For matching more for wanton lust than honour, <|nl|> Or than for strength and safety of our country. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BONA: <|nl|> Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged <|nl|> But by thy help to this distressed queen? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live, <|nl|> Unless thou rescue him from foul despair? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BONA: <|nl|> My quarrel and this English queen's are one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's. <|nl|> Therefore at last I firmly am resolved <|nl|> You shall have aid. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Let me give humble thanks for all at once. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Then, England's messenger, return in post, <|nl|> And tell false Edward, thy supposed king, <|nl|> That Lewis of France is sending over masquers <|nl|> To revel it with him and his new bride: <|nl|> Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BONA: <|nl|> Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly, <|nl|> I'll wear the willow garland for his sake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside, <|nl|> And I am ready to put armour on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, <|nl|> And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long. <|nl|> There's thy reward: be gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> But, Warwick, <|nl|> Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men, <|nl|> Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle; <|nl|> And, as occasion serves, this noble queen <|nl|> And prince shall follow with a fresh supply. <|nl|> Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt, <|nl|> What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> This shall assure my constant loyalty, <|nl|> That if our queen and this young prince agree, <|nl|> I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy <|nl|> To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion. <|nl|> Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous, <|nl|> Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick; <|nl|> And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable, <|nl|> That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it; <|nl|> And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING LEWIS XI: <|nl|> Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied, <|nl|> And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral, <|nl|> Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet. <|nl|> I long till Edward fall by war's mischance, <|nl|> For mocking marriage with a dame of France. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> I came from Edward as ambassador, <|nl|> But I return his sworn and mortal foe: <|nl|> Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me, <|nl|> But dreadful war shall answer his demand. <|nl|> Had he none else to make a stale but me? <|nl|> Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow. <|nl|> I was the chief that raised him to the crown, <|nl|> And I'll be chief to bring him down again: <|nl|> Not that I pity Henry's misery, <|nl|> But seek revenge on Edward's mockery. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you <|nl|> Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey? <|nl|> Hath not our brother made a worthy choice? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France; <|nl|> How could he stay till Warwick made return? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> And his well-chosen bride. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> I mind to tell him plainly what I think. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice, <|nl|> That you stand pensive, as half malcontent? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick, <|nl|> Which are so weak of courage and in judgment <|nl|> That they'll take no offence at our abuse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Suppose they take offence without a cause, <|nl|> They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward, <|nl|> Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> And shall have your will, because our king: <|nl|> Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Not I: <|nl|> No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd <|nl|> Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity <|nl|> To sunder them that yoke so well together. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Setting your scorns and your mislike aside, <|nl|> Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey <|nl|> Should not become my wife and England's queen. <|nl|> And you too, Somerset and Montague, <|nl|> Speak freely what you think. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis <|nl|> Becomes your enemy, for mocking him <|nl|> About the marriage of the Lady Bona. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge, <|nl|> Is now dishonoured by this new marriage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased <|nl|> By such invention as I can devise? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance <|nl|> Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth <|nl|> 'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Why, knows not Montague that of itself <|nl|> England is safe, if true within itself? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> But the safer when 'tis back'd with France. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> 'Tis better using France than trusting France: <|nl|> Let us be back'd with God and with the seas <|nl|> Which He hath given for fence impregnable, <|nl|> And with their helps only defend ourselves; <|nl|> In them and in ourselves our safety lies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves <|nl|> To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant; <|nl|> And for this once my will shall stand for law. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> And yet methinks your grace hath not done well, <|nl|> To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales <|nl|> Unto the brother of your loving bride; <|nl|> She better would have fitted me or Clarence: <|nl|> But in your bride you bury brotherhood. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir <|nl|> Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son, <|nl|> And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife <|nl|> That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment, <|nl|> Which being shallow, you give me leave <|nl|> To play the broker in mine own behalf; <|nl|> And to that end I shortly mind to leave you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king, <|nl|> And not be tied unto his brother's will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> My lords, before it pleased his majesty <|nl|> To raise my state to title of a queen, <|nl|> Do me but right, and you must all confess <|nl|> That I was not ignoble of descent; <|nl|> And meaner than myself have had like fortune. <|nl|> But as this title honours me and mine, <|nl|> So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing, <|nl|> Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns: <|nl|> What danger or what sorrow can befall thee, <|nl|> So long as Edward is thy constant friend, <|nl|> And their true sovereign, whom they must obey? <|nl|> Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too, <|nl|> Unless they seek for hatred at my hands; <|nl|> Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe, <|nl|> And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now, messenger, what letters or what news <|nl|> From France? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Post: <|nl|> My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words, <|nl|> But such as I, without your special pardon, <|nl|> Dare not relate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief, <|nl|> Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them. <|nl|> What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Post: <|nl|> At my depart, these were his very words: <|nl|> 'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king, <|nl|> That Lewis of France is sending over masquers <|nl|> To revel it with him and his new bride.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry. <|nl|> But what said Lady Bona to my marriage? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Post: <|nl|> These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain: <|nl|> 'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly, <|nl|> I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> I blame not her, she could say little less; <|nl|> She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen? <|nl|> For I have heard that she was there in place. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Post: <|nl|> 'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done, <|nl|> And I am ready to put armour on.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Belike she minds to play the Amazon. <|nl|> But what said Warwick to these injuries? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Post: <|nl|> He, more incensed against your majesty <|nl|> Than all the rest, discharged me with these words: <|nl|> 'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong, <|nl|> And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words? <|nl|> Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd: <|nl|> They shall have wars and pay for their presumption. <|nl|> But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Post: <|nl|> Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in <|nl|> friendship <|nl|> That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger. <|nl|> Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast, <|nl|> For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter; <|nl|> That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage <|nl|> I may not prove inferior to yourself. <|nl|> You that love me and Warwick, follow me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick! <|nl|> Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen; <|nl|> And haste is needful in this desperate case. <|nl|> Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf <|nl|> Go levy men, and make prepare for war; <|nl|> They are already, or quickly will be landed: <|nl|> Myself in person will straight follow you. <|nl|> But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague, <|nl|> Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest, <|nl|> Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance: <|nl|> Tell me if you love Warwick more than me? <|nl|> If it be so, then both depart to him; <|nl|> I rather wish you foes than hollow friends: <|nl|> But if you mind to hold your true obedience, <|nl|> Give me assurance with some friendly vow, <|nl|> That I may never have you in suspect. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> So God help Montague as he proves true! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Why, so! then am I sure of victory. <|nl|> Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour, <|nl|> Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well; <|nl|> The common people by numbers swarm to us. <|nl|> But see where Somerset and Clarence come! <|nl|> Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Fear not that, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick; <|nl|> And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice <|nl|> To rest mistrustful where a noble heart <|nl|> Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love; <|nl|> Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother, <|nl|> Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings: <|nl|> But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine. <|nl|> And now what rests but, in night's coverture, <|nl|> Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd, <|nl|> His soldiers lurking in the towns about, <|nl|> And but attended by a simple guard, <|nl|> We may surprise and take him at our pleasure? <|nl|> Our scouts have found the adventure very easy: <|nl|> That as Ulysses and stout Diomede <|nl|> With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents, <|nl|> And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds, <|nl|> So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle, <|nl|> At unawares may beat down Edward's guard <|nl|> And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him, <|nl|> For I intend but only to surprise him. <|nl|> You that will follow me to this attempt, <|nl|> Applaud the name of Henry with your leader. <|nl|> Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort: <|nl|> For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George! <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> Come on, my masters, each man take his stand: <|nl|> The king by this is set him down to sleep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Watchman: <|nl|> What, will he not to bed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow <|nl|> Never to lie and take his natural rest <|nl|> Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Watchman: <|nl|> To-morrow then belike shall be the day, <|nl|> If Warwick be so near as men report. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Watchman: <|nl|> But say, I pray, what nobleman is that <|nl|> That with the king here resteth in his tent? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Watchman: <|nl|> O, is it so? But why commands the king <|nl|> That his chief followers lodge in towns about him, <|nl|> While he himself keeps in the cold field? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Watchman: <|nl|> 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Watchman: <|nl|> Ay, but give me worship and quietness; <|nl|> I like it better than a dangerous honour. <|nl|> If Warwick knew in what estate he stands, <|nl|> 'Tis to be doubted he would waken him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> Unless our halberds did shut up his passage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Watchman: <|nl|> Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent, <|nl|> But to defend his person from night-foes? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> This is his tent; and see where stand his guard. <|nl|> Courage, my masters! honour now or never! <|nl|> But follow me, and Edward shall be ours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Watchman: <|nl|> Who goes there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Watchman: <|nl|> Stay, or thou diest! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> What are they that fly there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted, <|nl|> Thou call'dst me king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Ay, but the case is alter'd: <|nl|> When you disgraced me in my embassade, <|nl|> Then I degraded you from being king, <|nl|> And come now to create you Duke of York. <|nl|> Alas! how should you govern any kingdom, <|nl|> That know not how to use ambassadors, <|nl|> Nor how to be contented with one wife, <|nl|> Nor how to use your brothers brotherly, <|nl|> Nor how to study for the people's welfare, <|nl|> Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too? <|nl|> Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down. <|nl|> Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance, <|nl|> Of thee thyself and all thy complices, <|nl|> Edward will always bear himself as king: <|nl|> Though fortune's malice overthrow my state, <|nl|> My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king: <|nl|> But Henry now shall wear the English crown, <|nl|> And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow. <|nl|> My Lord of Somerset, at my request, <|nl|> See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd <|nl|> Unto my brother, Archbishop of York. <|nl|> When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows, <|nl|> I'll follow you, and tell what answer <|nl|> Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him. <|nl|> Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> What fates impose, that men must needs abide; <|nl|> It boots not to resist both wind and tide. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> What now remains, my lords, for us to do <|nl|> But march to London with our soldiers? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do; <|nl|> To free King Henry from imprisonment <|nl|> And see him seated in the regal throne. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Madam, what makes you in this sudden change? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn <|nl|> What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward? <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> No, but the loss of his own royal person. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> Then is my sovereign slain? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner, <|nl|> Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard <|nl|> Or by his foe surprised at unawares: <|nl|> And, as I further have to understand, <|nl|> Is new committed to the Bishop of York, <|nl|> Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> These news I must confess are full of grief; <|nl|> Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may: <|nl|> Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay. <|nl|> And I the rather wean me from despair <|nl|> For love of Edward's offspring in my womb: <|nl|> This is it that makes me bridle passion <|nl|> And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross; <|nl|> Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear <|nl|> And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs, <|nl|> Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown <|nl|> King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> RIVERS: <|nl|> But, madam, where is Warwick then become? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> I am inform'd that he comes towards London, <|nl|> To set the crown once more on Henry's head: <|nl|> Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down, <|nl|> But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,-- <|nl|> For trust not him that hath once broken faith,-- <|nl|> I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary, <|nl|> To save at least the heir of Edward's right: <|nl|> There shall I rest secure from force and fraud. <|nl|> Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly: <|nl|> If Warwick take us we are sure to die. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley, <|nl|> Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither, <|nl|> Into this chiefest thicket of the park. <|nl|> Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother, <|nl|> Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands <|nl|> He hath good usage and great liberty, <|nl|> And, often but attended with weak guard, <|nl|> Comes hunting this way to disport himself. <|nl|> I have advertised him by secret means <|nl|> That if about this hour he make his way <|nl|> Under the colour of his usual game, <|nl|> He shall here find his friends with horse and men <|nl|> To set him free from his captivity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Huntsman: <|nl|> This way, my lord; for this way lies the game. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand. <|nl|> Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest, <|nl|> Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Brother, the time and case requireth haste: <|nl|> Your horse stands ready at the park-corner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> But whither shall we then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> To Lynn, my lord, <|nl|> And ship from thence to Flanders. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Huntsman: <|nl|> Better do so than tarry and be hang'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown; <|nl|> And pray that I may repossess the crown. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Master lieutenant, now that God and friends <|nl|> Have shaken Edward from the regal seat, <|nl|> And turn'd my captive state to liberty, <|nl|> My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys, <|nl|> At our enlargement what are thy due fees? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lieutenant: <|nl|> Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns; <|nl|> But if an humble prayer may prevail, <|nl|> I then crave pardon of your majesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> For what, lieutenant? for well using me? <|nl|> Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness, <|nl|> For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure; <|nl|> Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds <|nl|> Conceive when after many moody thoughts <|nl|> At last by notes of household harmony <|nl|> They quite forget their loss of liberty. <|nl|> But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free, <|nl|> And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee; <|nl|> He was the author, thou the instrument. <|nl|> Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite <|nl|> By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me, <|nl|> And that the people of this blessed land <|nl|> May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars, <|nl|> Warwick, although my head still wear the crown, <|nl|> I here resign my government to thee, <|nl|> For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous; <|nl|> And now may seem as wise as virtuous, <|nl|> By spying and avoiding fortune's malice, <|nl|> For few men rightly temper with the stars: <|nl|> Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace, <|nl|> For choosing me when Clarence is in place. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, <|nl|> To whom the heavens in thy nativity <|nl|> Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown, <|nl|> As likely to be blest in peace and war; <|nl|> And therefore I yield thee my free consent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> And I choose Clarence only for protector. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands: <|nl|> Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts, <|nl|> That no dissension hinder government: <|nl|> I make you both protectors of this land, <|nl|> While I myself will lead a private life <|nl|> And in devotion spend my latter days, <|nl|> To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> That he consents, if Warwick yield consent; <|nl|> For on thy fortune I repose myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content: <|nl|> We'll yoke together, like a double shadow <|nl|> To Henry's body, and supply his place; <|nl|> I mean, in bearing weight of government, <|nl|> While he enjoys the honour and his ease. <|nl|> And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful <|nl|> Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor, <|nl|> And all his lands and goods be confiscate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> What else? and that succession be determined. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> But, with the first of all your chief affairs, <|nl|> Let me entreat, for I command no more, <|nl|> That Margaret your queen and my son Edward <|nl|> Be sent for, to return from France with speed; <|nl|> For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear <|nl|> My joy of liberty is half eclipsed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that, <|nl|> Of whom you seem to have so tender care? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Come hither, England's hope. <|nl|> If secret powers <|nl|> Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts, <|nl|> This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss. <|nl|> His looks are full of peaceful majesty, <|nl|> His head by nature framed to wear a crown, <|nl|> His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself <|nl|> Likely in time to bless a regal throne. <|nl|> Make much of him, my lords, for this is he <|nl|> Must help you more than you are hurt by me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> What news, my friend? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Post: <|nl|> That Edward is escaped from your brother, <|nl|> And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Unsavoury news! but how made he escape? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Post: <|nl|> He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester <|nl|> And the Lord Hastings, who attended him <|nl|> In secret ambush on the forest side <|nl|> And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him; <|nl|> For hunting was his daily exercise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> My brother was too careless of his charge. <|nl|> But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide <|nl|> A salve for any sore that may betide. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's; <|nl|> For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help, <|nl|> And we shall have more wars before 't be long. <|nl|> As Henry's late presaging prophecy <|nl|> Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond, <|nl|> So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts <|nl|> What may befall him, to his harm and ours: <|nl|> Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst, <|nl|> Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany, <|nl|> Till storms be past of civil enmity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown, <|nl|> 'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> It shall be so; he shall to Brittany. <|nl|> Come, therefore, let's about it speedily. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest, <|nl|> Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends, <|nl|> And says that once more I shall interchange <|nl|> My waned state for Henry's regal crown. <|nl|> Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas <|nl|> And brought desired help from Burgundy: <|nl|> What then remains, we being thus arrived <|nl|> From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York, <|nl|> But that we enter, as into our dukedom? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this; <|nl|> For many men that stumble at the threshold <|nl|> Are well foretold that danger lurks within. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us: <|nl|> By fair or foul means we must enter in, <|nl|> For hither will our friends repair to us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Mayor: <|nl|> My lords, we were forewarned of your coming, <|nl|> And shut the gates for safety of ourselves; <|nl|> For now we owe allegiance unto Henry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> But, master mayor, if Henry be your king, <|nl|> Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Mayor: <|nl|> True, my good lord; I know you for no less. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom, <|nl|> As being well content with that alone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt? <|nl|> Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Mayor: <|nl|> Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> The good old man would fain that all were well, <|nl|> So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd, <|nl|> I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade <|nl|> Both him and all his brothers unto reason. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut <|nl|> But in the night or in the time of war. <|nl|> What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys; <|nl|> For Edward will defend the town and thee, <|nl|> And all those friends that deign to follow me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery, <|nl|> Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> To help King Edward in his time of storm, <|nl|> As every loyal subject ought to do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget <|nl|> Our title to the crown and only claim <|nl|> Our dukedom till God please to send the rest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Then fare you well, for I will hence again: <|nl|> I came to serve a king and not a duke. <|nl|> Drummer, strike up, and let us march away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate <|nl|> By what safe means the crown may be recover'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> What talk you of debating? in few words, <|nl|> If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king, <|nl|> I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone <|nl|> To keep them back that come to succor you: <|nl|> Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim: <|nl|> Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns. <|nl|> Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand: <|nl|> The bruit thereof will bring you many friends. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right, <|nl|> And Henry but usurps the diadem. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself; <|nl|> And now will I be Edward's champion. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HASTINGS: <|nl|> Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd: <|nl|> Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Soldier: <|nl|> Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of <|nl|> England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right, <|nl|> By this I challenge him to single fight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> All: <|nl|> Long live Edward the Fourth! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all: <|nl|> If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness. <|nl|> Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York; <|nl|> And when the morning sun shall raise his car <|nl|> Above the border of this horizon, <|nl|> We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates; <|nl|> For well I wot that Henry is no soldier. <|nl|> Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee <|nl|> To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother! <|nl|> Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick. <|nl|> Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day, <|nl|> And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia, <|nl|> With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders, <|nl|> Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas, <|nl|> And with his troops doth march amain to London; <|nl|> And many giddy people flock to him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Let's levy men, and beat him back again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> A little fire is quickly trodden out; <|nl|> Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends, <|nl|> Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war; <|nl|> Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence, <|nl|> Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent, <|nl|> The knights and gentlemen to come with thee: <|nl|> Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham, <|nl|> Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find <|nl|> Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st: <|nl|> And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved, <|nl|> In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends. <|nl|> My sovereign, with the loving citizens, <|nl|> Like to his island girt in with the ocean, <|nl|> Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs, <|nl|> Shall rest in London till we come to him. <|nl|> Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply. <|nl|> Farewell, my sovereign. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague, <|nl|> And all at once, once more a happy farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Here at the palace I will rest awhile. <|nl|> Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship? <|nl|> Methinks the power that Edward hath in field <|nl|> Should not be able to encounter mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> The doubt is that he will seduce the rest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame: <|nl|> I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands, <|nl|> Nor posted off their suits with slow delays; <|nl|> My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds, <|nl|> My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs, <|nl|> My mercy dried their water-flowing tears; <|nl|> I have not been desirous of their wealth, <|nl|> Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies. <|nl|> Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd: <|nl|> Then why should they love Edward more than me? <|nl|> No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace: <|nl|> And when the lion fawns upon the lamb, <|nl|> The lamb will never cease to follow him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EXETER: <|nl|> Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence; <|nl|> And once again proclaim us King of England. <|nl|> You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow: <|nl|> Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry, <|nl|> And swell so much the higher by their ebb. <|nl|> Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak. <|nl|> And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course <|nl|> Where peremptory Warwick now remains: <|nl|> The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay, <|nl|> Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Away betimes, before his forces join, <|nl|> And take the great-grown traitor unawares: <|nl|> Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford? <|nl|> How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Messenger: <|nl|> By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> How far off is our brother Montague? <|nl|> Where is the post that came from Montague? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Messenger: <|nl|> By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Say, Somerville, what says my loving son? <|nl|> And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> At Southam I did leave him with his forces, <|nl|> And do expect him here some two hours hence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies: <|nl|> The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> They are at hand, and you shall quickly know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> See how the surly Warwick mans the wall! <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come? <|nl|> Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced, <|nl|> That we could hear no news of his repair? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates, <|nl|> Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee, <|nl|> Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy? <|nl|> And he shall pardon thee these outrages. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence, <|nl|> Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own, <|nl|> Call Warwick patron and be penitent? <|nl|> And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I thought, at least, he would have said the king; <|nl|> Or did he make the jest against his will? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give: <|nl|> I'll do thee service for so good a gift. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight: <|nl|> And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again; <|nl|> And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner: <|nl|> And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this: <|nl|> What is the body when the head is off? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast, <|nl|> But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten, <|nl|> The king was slily finger'd from the deck! <|nl|> You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace, <|nl|> And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EDWARD: <|nl|> 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down: <|nl|> Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> I had rather chop this hand off at a blow, <|nl|> And with the other fling it at thy face, <|nl|> Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend, <|nl|> This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair <|nl|> Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off, <|nl|> Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood, <|nl|> 'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes! <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> The gates are open, let us enter too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> So other foes may set upon our backs. <|nl|> Stand we in good array; for they no doubt <|nl|> Will issue out again and bid us battle: <|nl|> If not, the city being but of small defence, <|nl|> We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MONTAGUE: <|nl|> Montague, Montague, for Lancaster! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason <|nl|> Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> The harder match'd, the greater victory: <|nl|> My mind presageth happy gain and conquest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset, <|nl|> Have sold their lives unto the house of York; <|nl|> And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along, <|nl|> Of force enough to bid his brother battle; <|nl|> With whom an upright zeal to right prevails <|nl|> More than the nature of a brother's love! <|nl|> Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Father of Warwick, know you what this means? <|nl|> Look here, I throw my infamy at thee <|nl|> I will not ruinate my father's house, <|nl|> Who gave his blood to lime the stones together, <|nl|> And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick, <|nl|> That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural, <|nl|> To bend the fatal instruments of war <|nl|> Against his brother and his lawful king? <|nl|> Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath: <|nl|> To keep that oath were more impiety <|nl|> Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter. <|nl|> I am so sorry for my trespass made <|nl|> That, to deserve well at my brother's hands, <|nl|> I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe, <|nl|> With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee-- <|nl|> As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad-- <|nl|> To plague thee for thy foul misleading me. <|nl|> And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee, <|nl|> And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks. <|nl|> Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends: <|nl|> And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults, <|nl|> For I will henceforth be no more unconstant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved, <|nl|> Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> O passing traitor, perjured and unjust! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight? <|nl|> Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears? <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence! <|nl|> I will away towards Barnet presently, <|nl|> And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way. <|nl|> Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory! <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear; <|nl|> For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all. <|nl|> Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee, <|nl|> That Warwick's bones may keep thine company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe, <|nl|> And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick? <|nl|> Why ask I that? my mangled body shows, <|nl|> My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows. <|nl|> That I must yield my body to the earth <|nl|> And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe. <|nl|> Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, <|nl|> Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, <|nl|> Under whose shade the ramping lion slept, <|nl|> Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree <|nl|> And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind. <|nl|> These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil, <|nl|> Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun, <|nl|> To search the secret treasons of the world: <|nl|> The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood, <|nl|> Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres; <|nl|> For who lived king, but I could dig his grave? <|nl|> And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow? <|nl|> Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood! <|nl|> My parks, my walks, my manors that I had. <|nl|> Even now forsake me, and of all my lands <|nl|> Is nothing left me but my body's length. <|nl|> Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust? <|nl|> And, live we how we can, yet die we must. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are. <|nl|> We might recover all our loss again; <|nl|> The queen from France hath brought a puissant power: <|nl|> Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly! <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague, <|nl|> If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand. <|nl|> And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile! <|nl|> Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst, <|nl|> Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood <|nl|> That glues my lips and will not let me speak. <|nl|> Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last; <|nl|> And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick, <|nl|> And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.' <|nl|> And more he would have said, and more he spoke, <|nl|> Which sounded like a clamour in a vault, <|nl|> That mought not be distinguished; but at last <|nl|> I well might hear, delivered with a groan, <|nl|> 'O, farewell, Warwick!' <|nl|>  <|nl|> WARWICK: <|nl|> Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves; <|nl|> For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> Away, away, to meet the queen's great power! <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course, <|nl|> And we are graced with wreaths of victory. <|nl|> But, in the midst of this bright-shining day, <|nl|> I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud, <|nl|> That will encounter with our glorious sun, <|nl|> Ere he attain his easeful western bed: <|nl|> I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen <|nl|> Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast <|nl|> And, as we hear, march on to fight with us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> A little gale will soon disperse that cloud <|nl|> And blow it to the source from whence it came: <|nl|> The very beams will dry those vapours up, <|nl|> For every cloud engenders not a storm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> The queen is valued thirty thousand strong, <|nl|> And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her: <|nl|> If she have time to breathe be well assured <|nl|> Her faction will be full as strong as ours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> We are advertised by our loving friends <|nl|> That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury: <|nl|> We, having now the best at Barnet field, <|nl|> Will thither straight, for willingness rids way; <|nl|> And, as we march, our strength will be augmented <|nl|> In every county as we go along. <|nl|> Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss, <|nl|> But cheerly seek how to redress their harms. <|nl|> What though the mast be now blown overboard, <|nl|> The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost, <|nl|> And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood? <|nl|> Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he <|nl|> Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad <|nl|> With tearful eyes add water to the sea <|nl|> And give more strength to that which hath too much, <|nl|> Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock, <|nl|> Which industry and courage might have saved? <|nl|> Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this! <|nl|> Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that? <|nl|> And Montague our topmost; what of him? <|nl|> Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these? <|nl|> Why, is not Oxford here another anchor? <|nl|> And Somerset another goodly mast? <|nl|> The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings? <|nl|> And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I <|nl|> For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge? <|nl|> We will not from the helm to sit and weep, <|nl|> But keep our course, though the rough wind say no, <|nl|> From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck. <|nl|> As good to chide the waves as speak them fair. <|nl|> And what is Edward but ruthless sea? <|nl|> What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit? <|nl|> And Richard but a ragged fatal rock? <|nl|> All these the enemies to our poor bark. <|nl|> Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while! <|nl|> Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink: <|nl|> Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off, <|nl|> Or else you famish; that's a threefold death. <|nl|> This speak I, lords, to let you understand, <|nl|> If case some one of you would fly from us, <|nl|> That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers <|nl|> More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks. <|nl|> Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided <|nl|> 'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit <|nl|> Should, if a coward heard her speak these words, <|nl|> Infuse his breast with magnanimity <|nl|> And make him, naked, foil a man at arms. <|nl|> I speak not this as doubting any here <|nl|> For did I but suspect a fearful man <|nl|> He should have leave to go away betimes, <|nl|> Lest in our need he might infect another <|nl|> And make him of like spirit to himself. <|nl|> If any such be here--as God forbid!-- <|nl|> Let him depart before we need his help. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> Women and children of so high a courage, <|nl|> And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame. <|nl|> O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather <|nl|> Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live <|nl|> To bear his image and renew his glories! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> And he that will not fight for such a hope. <|nl|> Go home to bed, and like the owl by day, <|nl|> If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand. <|nl|> Ready to fight; therefore be resolute. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> I thought no less: it is his policy <|nl|> To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> But he's deceived; we are in readiness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood, <|nl|> Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength, <|nl|> Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night. <|nl|> I need not add more fuel to your fire, <|nl|> For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out <|nl|> Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords! <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say <|nl|> My tears gainsay; for every word I speak, <|nl|> Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes. <|nl|> Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign, <|nl|> Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd, <|nl|> His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain, <|nl|> His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent; <|nl|> And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil. <|nl|> You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords, <|nl|> Be valiant and give signal to the fight. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now here a period of tumultuous broils. <|nl|> Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight: <|nl|> For Somerset, off with his guilty head. <|nl|> Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> OXFORD: <|nl|> For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SOMERSET: <|nl|> Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> So part we sadly in this troublous world, <|nl|> To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward <|nl|> Shall have a high reward, and he his life? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak. <|nl|> What! can so young a thorn begin to prick? <|nl|> Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make <|nl|> For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects, <|nl|> And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York! <|nl|> Suppose that I am now my father's mouth; <|nl|> Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou, <|nl|> Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee, <|nl|> Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Ah, that thy father had been so resolved! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> That you might still have worn the petticoat, <|nl|> And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Let AEsop fable in a winter's night; <|nl|> His currish riddles sort not with this place. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> For God's sake, take away this captive scold. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PRINCE EDWARD: <|nl|> I know my duty; you are all undutiful: <|nl|> Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George, <|nl|> And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all <|nl|> I am your better, traitors as ye are: <|nl|> And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Take that, thou likeness of this railer here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> And there's for twitting me with perjury. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> O, kill me too! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Marry, and shall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Why should she live, to fill the world with words? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother; <|nl|> I'll hence to London on a serious matter: <|nl|> Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> What? what? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> The Tower, the Tower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy! <|nl|> Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers! <|nl|> They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all, <|nl|> Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame, <|nl|> If this foul deed were by to equal it: <|nl|> He was a man; this, in respect, a child: <|nl|> And men ne'er spend their fury on a child. <|nl|> What's worse than murderer, that I may name it? <|nl|> No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak: <|nl|> And I will speak, that so my heart may burst. <|nl|> Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals! <|nl|> How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd! <|nl|> You have no children, butchers! if you had, <|nl|> The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse: <|nl|> But if you ever chance to have a child, <|nl|> Look in his youth to have him so cut off <|nl|> As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here, <|nl|> Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death: <|nl|> What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself: <|nl|> 'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity. <|nl|> What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher, <|nl|> Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou? <|nl|> Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed; <|nl|> Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN MARGARET: <|nl|> So come to you and yours, as to this Prince! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Where's Richard gone? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> To London, all in post; and, as I guess, <|nl|> To make a bloody supper in the Tower. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head. <|nl|> Now march we hence: discharge the common sort <|nl|> With pay and thanks, and let's away to London <|nl|> And see our gentle queen how well she fares: <|nl|> By this, I hope, she hath a son for me. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather; <|nl|> 'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better: <|nl|> 'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike, <|nl|> And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf; <|nl|> So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece <|nl|> And next his throat unto the butcher's knife. <|nl|> What scene of death hath Roscius now to act? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind; <|nl|> The thief doth fear each bush an officer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> The bird that hath been limed in a bush, <|nl|> With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush; <|nl|> And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird, <|nl|> Have now the fatal object in my eye <|nl|> Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete, <|nl|> That taught his son the office of a fowl! <|nl|> An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus; <|nl|> Thy father, Minos, that denied our course; <|nl|> The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy <|nl|> Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea <|nl|> Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life. <|nl|> Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words! <|nl|> My breast can better brook thy dagger's point <|nl|> Than can my ears that tragic history. <|nl|> But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Think'st thou I am an executioner? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> A persecutor, I am sure, thou art: <|nl|> If murdering innocents be executing, <|nl|> Why, then thou art an executioner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> Thy son I kill'd for his presumption. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume, <|nl|> Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine. <|nl|> And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand, <|nl|> Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear, <|nl|> And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's, <|nl|> And many an orphan's water-standing eye-- <|nl|> Men for their sons, wives for their husbands, <|nl|> And orphans for their parents timeless death-- <|nl|> Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born. <|nl|> The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign; <|nl|> The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time; <|nl|> Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees; <|nl|> The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top, <|nl|> And chattering pies in dismal discords sung. <|nl|> Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain, <|nl|> And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope, <|nl|> To wit, an indigested and deformed lump, <|nl|> Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree. <|nl|> Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born, <|nl|> To signify thou camest to bite the world: <|nl|> And, if the rest be true which I have heard, <|nl|> Thou camest-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech: <|nl|> For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING HENRY VI: <|nl|> Ay, and for much more slaughter after this. <|nl|> God forgive my sins, and pardon thee! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster <|nl|> Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted. <|nl|> See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death! <|nl|> O, may such purple tears be alway shed <|nl|> From those that wish the downfall of our house! <|nl|> If any spark of life be yet remaining, <|nl|> Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither: <|nl|> I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear. <|nl|> Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of; <|nl|> For I have often heard my mother say <|nl|> I came into the world with my legs forward: <|nl|> Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste, <|nl|> And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right? <|nl|> The midwife wonder'd and the women cried <|nl|> 'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!' <|nl|> And so I was; which plainly signified <|nl|> That I should snarl and bite and play the dog. <|nl|> Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so, <|nl|> Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it. <|nl|> I have no brother, I am like no brother; <|nl|> And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine, <|nl|> Be resident in men like one another <|nl|> And not in me: I am myself alone. <|nl|> Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light: <|nl|> But I will sort a pitchy day for thee; <|nl|> For I will buz abroad such prophecies <|nl|> That Edward shall be fearful of his life, <|nl|> And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death. <|nl|> King Henry and the prince his son are gone: <|nl|> Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest, <|nl|> Counting myself but bad till I be best. <|nl|> I'll throw thy body in another room <|nl|> And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom. <|nl|> 3 KING HENRY VI <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Once more we sit in England's royal throne, <|nl|> Re-purchased with the blood of enemies. <|nl|> What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn, <|nl|> Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride! <|nl|> Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd <|nl|> For hardy and undoubted champions; <|nl|> Two Cliffords, as the father and the son, <|nl|> And two Northumberlands; two braver men <|nl|> Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound; <|nl|> With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague, <|nl|> That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion <|nl|> And made the forest tremble when they roar'd. <|nl|> Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat <|nl|> And made our footstool of security. <|nl|> Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy. <|nl|> Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself <|nl|> Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night, <|nl|> Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat, <|nl|> That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace; <|nl|> And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen; <|nl|> And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> The duty that I owe unto your majesty <|nl|> I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> QUEEN ELIZABETH: <|nl|> Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GLOUCESTER: <|nl|> And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st, <|nl|> Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Now am I seated as my soul delights, <|nl|> Having my country's peace and brothers' loves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLARENCE: <|nl|> What will your grace have done with Margaret? <|nl|> Reignier, her father, to the king of France <|nl|> Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem, <|nl|> And hither have they sent it for her ransom. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KING EDWARD IV: <|nl|> Away with her, and waft her hence to France. <|nl|> And now what rests but that we spend the time <|nl|> With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows, <|nl|> Such as befits the pleasure of the court? <|nl|> Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy! <|nl|> For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHIDAMUS: <|nl|> If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on <|nl|> the like occasion whereon my services are now on <|nl|> foot, you shall see, as I have said, great <|nl|> difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia <|nl|> means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHIDAMUS: <|nl|> Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be <|nl|> justified in our loves; for indeed-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Beseech you,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHIDAMUS: <|nl|> Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: <|nl|> we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know <|nl|> not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks, <|nl|> that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, <|nl|> may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse <|nl|> us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHIDAMUS: <|nl|> Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me <|nl|> and as mine honesty puts it to utterance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. <|nl|> They were trained together in their childhoods; and <|nl|> there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, <|nl|> which cannot choose but branch now. Since their <|nl|> more mature dignities and royal necessities made <|nl|> separation of their society, their encounters, <|nl|> though not personal, have been royally attorneyed <|nl|> with interchange of gifts, letters, loving <|nl|> embassies; that they have seemed to be together, <|nl|> though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and <|nl|> embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed <|nl|> winds. The heavens continue their loves! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHIDAMUS: <|nl|> I think there is not in the world either malice or <|nl|> matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable <|nl|> comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a <|nl|> gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came <|nl|> into my note. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it <|nl|> is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the <|nl|> subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on <|nl|> crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to <|nl|> see him a man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHIDAMUS: <|nl|> Would they else be content to die? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should <|nl|> desire to live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARCHIDAMUS: <|nl|> If the king had no son, they would desire to live <|nl|> on crutches till he had one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Nine changes of the watery star hath been <|nl|> The shepherd's note since we have left our throne <|nl|> Without a burthen: time as long again <|nl|> Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks; <|nl|> And yet we should, for perpetuity, <|nl|> Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher, <|nl|> Yet standing in rich place, I multiply <|nl|> With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe <|nl|> That go before it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Stay your thanks a while; <|nl|> And pay them when you part. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Sir, that's to-morrow. <|nl|> I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance <|nl|> Or breed upon our absence; that may blow <|nl|> No sneaping winds at home, to make us say <|nl|> 'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd <|nl|> To tire your royalty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> We are tougher, brother, <|nl|> Than you can put us to't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> No longer stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> One seven-night longer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Very sooth, to-morrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> We'll part the time between's then; and in that <|nl|> I'll no gainsaying. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Press me not, beseech you, so. <|nl|> There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world, <|nl|> So soon as yours could win me: so it should now, <|nl|> Were there necessity in your request, although <|nl|> 'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs <|nl|> Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder <|nl|> Were in your love a whip to me; my stay <|nl|> To you a charge and trouble: to save both, <|nl|> Farewell, our brother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Tongue-tied, our queen? <|nl|> speak you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until <|nl|> You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir, <|nl|> Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure <|nl|> All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction <|nl|> The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him, <|nl|> He's beat from his best ward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Well said, Hermione. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong: <|nl|> But let him say so then, and let him go; <|nl|> But let him swear so, and he shall not stay, <|nl|> We'll thwack him hence with distaffs. <|nl|> Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure <|nl|> The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia <|nl|> You take my lord, I'll give him my commission <|nl|> To let him there a month behind the gest <|nl|> Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes, <|nl|> I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind <|nl|> What lady-she her lord. You'll stay? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> No, madam. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Nay, but you will? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> I may not, verily. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Verily! <|nl|> You put me off with limber vows; but I, <|nl|> Though you would seek to unsphere the <|nl|> stars with oaths, <|nl|> Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily, <|nl|> You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's <|nl|> As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet? <|nl|> Force me to keep you as a prisoner, <|nl|> Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees <|nl|> When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you? <|nl|> My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,' <|nl|> One of them you shall be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Your guest, then, madam: <|nl|> To be your prisoner should import offending; <|nl|> Which is for me less easy to commit <|nl|> Than you to punish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Not your gaoler, then, <|nl|> But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you <|nl|> Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys: <|nl|> You were pretty lordings then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> We were, fair queen, <|nl|> Two lads that thought there was no more behind <|nl|> But such a day to-morrow as to-day, <|nl|> And to be boy eternal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Was not my lord <|nl|> The verier wag o' the two? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun, <|nl|> And bleat the one at the other: what we changed <|nl|> Was innocence for innocence; we knew not <|nl|> The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd <|nl|> That any did. Had we pursued that life, <|nl|> And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd <|nl|> With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven <|nl|> Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd <|nl|> Hereditary ours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> By this we gather <|nl|> You have tripp'd since. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> O my most sacred lady! <|nl|> Temptations have since then been born to's; for <|nl|> In those unfledged days was my wife a girl; <|nl|> Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes <|nl|> Of my young play-fellow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Grace to boot! <|nl|> Of this make no conclusion, lest you say <|nl|> Your queen and I are devils: yet go on; <|nl|> The offences we have made you do we'll answer, <|nl|> If you first sinn'd with us and that with us <|nl|> You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not <|nl|> With any but with us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Is he won yet? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> He'll stay my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> At my request he would not. <|nl|> Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest <|nl|> To better purpose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Never? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Never, but once. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> What! have I twice said well? when was't before? <|nl|> I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's <|nl|> As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless <|nl|> Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that. <|nl|> Our praises are our wages: you may ride's <|nl|> With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere <|nl|> With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal: <|nl|> My last good deed was to entreat his stay: <|nl|> What was my first? it has an elder sister, <|nl|> Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace! <|nl|> But once before I spoke to the purpose: when? <|nl|> Nay, let me have't; I long. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Why, that was when <|nl|> Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death, <|nl|> Ere I could make thee open thy white hand <|nl|> And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter <|nl|> 'I am yours for ever.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> 'Tis grace indeed. <|nl|> Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice: <|nl|> The one for ever earn'd a royal husband; <|nl|> The other for some while a friend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> Ay, my good lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> I' fecks! <|nl|> Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast <|nl|> smutch'd thy nose? <|nl|> They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain, <|nl|> We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain: <|nl|> And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf <|nl|> Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling <|nl|> Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf! <|nl|> Art thou my calf? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> Yes, if you will, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have, <|nl|> To be full like me: yet they say we are <|nl|> Almost as like as eggs; women say so, <|nl|> That will say anything but were they false <|nl|> As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false <|nl|> As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes <|nl|> No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true <|nl|> To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page, <|nl|> Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain! <|nl|> Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?-- <|nl|> Affection! thy intention stabs the centre: <|nl|> Thou dost make possible things not so held, <|nl|> Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?-- <|nl|> With what's unreal thou coactive art, <|nl|> And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent <|nl|> Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost, <|nl|> And that beyond commission, and I find it, <|nl|> And that to the infection of my brains <|nl|> And hardening of my brows. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> What means Sicilia? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> He something seems unsettled. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> How, my lord! <|nl|> What cheer? how is't with you, best brother? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> You look as if you held a brow of much distraction <|nl|> Are you moved, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> No, in good earnest. <|nl|> How sometimes nature will betray its folly, <|nl|> Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime <|nl|> To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines <|nl|> Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil <|nl|> Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd, <|nl|> In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled, <|nl|> Lest it should bite its master, and so prove, <|nl|> As ornaments oft do, too dangerous: <|nl|> How like, methought, I then was to this kernel, <|nl|> This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend, <|nl|> Will you take eggs for money? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> No, my lord, I'll fight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother, <|nl|> Are you so fond of your young prince as we <|nl|> Do seem to be of ours? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> If at home, sir, <|nl|> He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter, <|nl|> Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy, <|nl|> My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all: <|nl|> He makes a July's day short as December, <|nl|> And with his varying childness cures in me <|nl|> Thoughts that would thick my blood. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> So stands this squire <|nl|> Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord, <|nl|> And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione, <|nl|> How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome; <|nl|> Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap: <|nl|> Next to thyself and my young rover, he's <|nl|> Apparent to my heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> If you would seek us, <|nl|> We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found, <|nl|> Be you beneath the sky. <|nl|> I am angling now, <|nl|> Though you perceive me not how I give line. <|nl|> Go to, go to! <|nl|> How she holds up the neb, the bill to him! <|nl|> And arms her with the boldness of a wife <|nl|> To her allowing husband! <|nl|> Gone already! <|nl|> Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and <|nl|> ears a fork'd one! <|nl|> Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I <|nl|> Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue <|nl|> Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour <|nl|> Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. <|nl|> There have been, <|nl|> Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now; <|nl|> And many a man there is, even at this present, <|nl|> Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm, <|nl|> That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence <|nl|> And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by <|nl|> Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't <|nl|> Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd, <|nl|> As mine, against their will. Should all despair <|nl|> That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind <|nl|> Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none; <|nl|> It is a bawdy planet, that will strike <|nl|> Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it, <|nl|> From east, west, north and south: be it concluded, <|nl|> No barricado for a belly; know't; <|nl|> It will let in and out the enemy <|nl|> With bag and baggage: many thousand on's <|nl|> Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> I am like you, they say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Ay, my good lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man. <|nl|> Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> You had much ado to make his anchor hold: <|nl|> When you cast out, it still came home. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Didst note it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> He would not stay at your petitions: made <|nl|> His business more material. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Didst perceive it? <|nl|> They're here with me already, whispering, rounding <|nl|> 'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone, <|nl|> When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo, <|nl|> That he did stay? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> At the good queen's entreaty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent <|nl|> But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken <|nl|> By any understanding pate but thine? <|nl|> For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in <|nl|> More than the common blocks: not noted, is't, <|nl|> But of the finer natures? by some severals <|nl|> Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes <|nl|> Perchance are to this business purblind? say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Business, my lord! I think most understand <|nl|> Bohemia stays here longer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Ha! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Stays here longer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Ay, but why? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> To satisfy your highness and the entreaties <|nl|> Of our most gracious mistress. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Satisfy! <|nl|> The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy! <|nl|> Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo, <|nl|> With all the nearest things to my heart, as well <|nl|> My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou <|nl|> Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed <|nl|> Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been <|nl|> Deceived in thy integrity, deceived <|nl|> In that which seems so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Be it forbid, my lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or, <|nl|> If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward, <|nl|> Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining <|nl|> From course required; or else thou must be counted <|nl|> A servant grafted in my serious trust <|nl|> And therein negligent; or else a fool <|nl|> That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn, <|nl|> And takest it all for jest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> My gracious lord, <|nl|> I may be negligent, foolish and fearful; <|nl|> In every one of these no man is free, <|nl|> But that his negligence, his folly, fear, <|nl|> Among the infinite doings of the world, <|nl|> Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord, <|nl|> If ever I were wilful-negligent, <|nl|> It was my folly; if industriously <|nl|> I play'd the fool, it was my negligence, <|nl|> Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful <|nl|> To do a thing, where I the issue doubted, <|nl|> Where of the execution did cry out <|nl|> Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear <|nl|> Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord, <|nl|> Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty <|nl|> Is never free of. But, beseech your grace, <|nl|> Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass <|nl|> By its own visage: if I then deny it, <|nl|> 'Tis none of mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Ha' not you seen, Camillo,-- <|nl|> But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass <|nl|> Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,-- <|nl|> For to a vision so apparent rumour <|nl|> Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation <|nl|> Resides not in that man that does not think,-- <|nl|> My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess, <|nl|> Or else be impudently negative, <|nl|> To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say <|nl|> My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name <|nl|> As rank as any flax-wench that puts to <|nl|> Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I would not be a stander-by to hear <|nl|> My sovereign mistress clouded so, without <|nl|> My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart, <|nl|> You never spoke what did become you less <|nl|> Than this; which to reiterate were sin <|nl|> As deep as that, though true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Is whispering nothing? <|nl|> Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? <|nl|> Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career <|nl|> Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible <|nl|> Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot? <|nl|> Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift? <|nl|> Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes <|nl|> Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, <|nl|> That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing? <|nl|> Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; <|nl|> The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing; <|nl|> My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, <|nl|> If this be nothing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Good my lord, be cured <|nl|> Of this diseased opinion, and betimes; <|nl|> For 'tis most dangerous. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Say it be, 'tis true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> No, no, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> It is; you lie, you lie: <|nl|> I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee, <|nl|> Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave, <|nl|> Or else a hovering temporizer, that <|nl|> Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil, <|nl|> Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver <|nl|> Infected as her life, she would not live <|nl|> The running of one glass. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Who does infect her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging <|nl|> About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I <|nl|> Had servants true about me, that bare eyes <|nl|> To see alike mine honour as their profits, <|nl|> Their own particular thrifts, they would do that <|nl|> Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou, <|nl|> His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form <|nl|> Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see <|nl|> Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven, <|nl|> How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup, <|nl|> To give mine enemy a lasting wink; <|nl|> Which draught to me were cordial. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Sir, my lord, <|nl|> I could do this, and that with no rash potion, <|nl|> But with a lingering dram that should not work <|nl|> Maliciously like poison: but I cannot <|nl|> Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress, <|nl|> So sovereignly being honourable. <|nl|> I have loved thee,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Make that thy question, and go rot! <|nl|> Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled, <|nl|> To appoint myself in this vexation, sully <|nl|> The purity and whiteness of my sheets, <|nl|> Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted <|nl|> Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps, <|nl|> Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son, <|nl|> Who I do think is mine and love as mine, <|nl|> Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this? <|nl|> Could man so blench? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I must believe you, sir: <|nl|> I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't; <|nl|> Provided that, when he's removed, your highness <|nl|> Will take again your queen as yours at first, <|nl|> Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing <|nl|> The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms <|nl|> Known and allied to yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Thou dost advise me <|nl|> Even so as I mine own course have set down: <|nl|> I'll give no blemish to her honour, none. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> My lord, <|nl|> Go then; and with a countenance as clear <|nl|> As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia <|nl|> And with your queen. I am his cupbearer: <|nl|> If from me he have wholesome beverage, <|nl|> Account me not your servant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> This is all: <|nl|> Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart; <|nl|> Do't not, thou split'st thine own. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I'll do't, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> O miserable lady! But, for me, <|nl|> What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner <|nl|> Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't <|nl|> Is the obedience to a master, one <|nl|> Who in rebellion with himself will have <|nl|> All that are his so too. To do this deed, <|nl|> Promotion follows. If I could find example <|nl|> Of thousands that had struck anointed kings <|nl|> And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since <|nl|> Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one, <|nl|> Let villany itself forswear't. I must <|nl|> Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain <|nl|> To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now! <|nl|> Here comes Bohemia. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> This is strange: methinks <|nl|> My favour here begins to warp. Not speak? <|nl|> Good day, Camillo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Hail, most royal sir! <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> What is the news i' the court? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> None rare, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> The king hath on him such a countenance <|nl|> As he had lost some province and a region <|nl|> Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him <|nl|> With customary compliment; when he, <|nl|> Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling <|nl|> A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and <|nl|> So leaves me to consider what is breeding <|nl|> That changeth thus his manners. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I dare not know, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not? <|nl|> Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts; <|nl|> For, to yourself, what you do know, you must. <|nl|> And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo, <|nl|> Your changed complexions are to me a mirror <|nl|> Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be <|nl|> A party in this alteration, finding <|nl|> Myself thus alter'd with 't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> There is a sickness <|nl|> Which puts some of us in distemper, but <|nl|> I cannot name the disease; and it is caught <|nl|> Of you that yet are well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> How! caught of me! <|nl|> Make me not sighted like the basilisk: <|nl|> I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better <|nl|> By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,-- <|nl|> As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto <|nl|> Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns <|nl|> Our gentry than our parents' noble names, <|nl|> In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you, <|nl|> If you know aught which does behove my knowledge <|nl|> Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not <|nl|> In ignorant concealment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I may not answer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> A sickness caught of me, and yet I well! <|nl|> I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo, <|nl|> I conjure thee, by all the parts of man <|nl|> Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least <|nl|> Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare <|nl|> What incidency thou dost guess of harm <|nl|> Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near; <|nl|> Which way to be prevented, if to be; <|nl|> If not, how best to bear it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Sir, I will tell you; <|nl|> Since I am charged in honour and by him <|nl|> That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel, <|nl|> Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as <|nl|> I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me <|nl|> Cry lost, and so good night! <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> On, good Camillo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I am appointed him to murder you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> By whom, Camillo? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> By the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> For what? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears, <|nl|> As he had seen't or been an instrument <|nl|> To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen <|nl|> Forbiddenly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> O, then my best blood turn <|nl|> To an infected jelly and my name <|nl|> Be yoked with his that did betray the Best! <|nl|> Turn then my freshest reputation to <|nl|> A savour that may strike the dullest nostril <|nl|> Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd, <|nl|> Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection <|nl|> That e'er was heard or read! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Swear his thought over <|nl|> By each particular star in heaven and <|nl|> By all their influences, you may as well <|nl|> Forbid the sea for to obey the moon <|nl|> As or by oath remove or counsel shake <|nl|> The fabric of his folly, whose foundation <|nl|> Is piled upon his faith and will continue <|nl|> The standing of his body. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> How should this grow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to <|nl|> Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born. <|nl|> If therefore you dare trust my honesty, <|nl|> That lies enclosed in this trunk which you <|nl|> Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night! <|nl|> Your followers I will whisper to the business, <|nl|> And will by twos and threes at several posterns <|nl|> Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put <|nl|> My fortunes to your service, which are here <|nl|> By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain; <|nl|> For, by the honour of my parents, I <|nl|> Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove, <|nl|> I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer <|nl|> Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon <|nl|> His execution sworn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> I do believe thee: <|nl|> I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand: <|nl|> Be pilot to me and thy places shall <|nl|> Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and <|nl|> My people did expect my hence departure <|nl|> Two days ago. This jealousy <|nl|> Is for a precious creature: as she's rare, <|nl|> Must it be great, and as his person's mighty, <|nl|> Must it be violent, and as he does conceive <|nl|> He is dishonour'd by a man which ever <|nl|> Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must <|nl|> In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me: <|nl|> Good expedition be my friend, and comfort <|nl|> The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing <|nl|> Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo; <|nl|> I will respect thee as a father if <|nl|> Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> It is in mine authority to command <|nl|> The keys of all the posterns: please your highness <|nl|> To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Take the boy to you: he so troubles me, <|nl|> 'Tis past enduring. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lady: <|nl|> Come, my gracious lord, <|nl|> Shall I be your playfellow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> No, I'll none of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lady: <|nl|> Why, my sweet lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if <|nl|> I were a baby still. I love you better. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Lady: <|nl|> And why so, my lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> Not for because <|nl|> Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say, <|nl|> Become some women best, so that there be not <|nl|> Too much hair there, but in a semicircle <|nl|> Or a half-moon made with a pen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Lady: <|nl|> Who taught you this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now <|nl|> What colour are your eyebrows? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lady: <|nl|> Blue, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose <|nl|> That has been blue, but not her eyebrows. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lady: <|nl|> Hark ye; <|nl|> The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall <|nl|> Present our services to a fine new prince <|nl|> One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us, <|nl|> If we would have you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Lady: <|nl|> She is spread of late <|nl|> Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now <|nl|> I am for you again: pray you, sit by us, <|nl|> And tell 's a tale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> Merry or sad shall't be? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> As merry as you will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> A sad tale's best for winter: I have one <|nl|> Of sprites and goblins. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Let's have that, good sir. <|nl|> Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best <|nl|> To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> There was a man-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Nay, come, sit down; then on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MAMILLIUS: <|nl|> Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly; <|nl|> Yond crickets shall not hear it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Come on, then, <|nl|> And give't me in mine ear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never <|nl|> Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them <|nl|> Even to their ships. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> How blest am I <|nl|> In my just censure, in my true opinion! <|nl|> Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed <|nl|> In being so blest! There may be in the cup <|nl|> A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart, <|nl|> And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge <|nl|> Is not infected: but if one present <|nl|> The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known <|nl|> How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides, <|nl|> With violent hefts. I have drunk, <|nl|> and seen the spider. <|nl|> Camillo was his help in this, his pander: <|nl|> There is a plot against my life, my crown; <|nl|> All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain <|nl|> Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him: <|nl|> He has discover'd my design, and I <|nl|> Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick <|nl|> For them to play at will. How came the posterns <|nl|> So easily open? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> By his great authority; <|nl|> Which often hath no less prevail'd than so <|nl|> On your command. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> I know't too well. <|nl|> Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him: <|nl|> Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you <|nl|> Have too much blood in him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> What is this? sport? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her; <|nl|> Away with him! and let her sport herself <|nl|> With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes <|nl|> Has made thee swell thus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> But I'ld say he had not, <|nl|> And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying, <|nl|> Howe'er you lean to the nayward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> You, my lords, <|nl|> Look on her, mark her well; be but about <|nl|> To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and <|nl|> The justice of your bearts will thereto add <|nl|> 'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:' <|nl|> Praise her but for this her without-door form, <|nl|> Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight <|nl|> The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands <|nl|> That calumny doth use--O, I am out-- <|nl|> That mercy does, for calumny will sear <|nl|> Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's, <|nl|> When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between <|nl|> Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known, <|nl|> From him that has most cause to grieve it should be, <|nl|> She's an adulteress. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Should a villain say so, <|nl|> The most replenish'd villain in the world, <|nl|> He were as much more villain: you, my lord, <|nl|> Do but mistake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> You have mistook, my lady, <|nl|> Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing! <|nl|> Which I'll not call a creature of thy place, <|nl|> Lest barbarism, making me the precedent, <|nl|> Should a like language use to all degrees <|nl|> And mannerly distinguishment leave out <|nl|> Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said <|nl|> She's an adulteress; I have said with whom: <|nl|> More, she's a traitor and Camillo is <|nl|> A federary with her, and one that knows <|nl|> What she should shame to know herself <|nl|> But with her most vile principal, that she's <|nl|> A bed-swerver, even as bad as those <|nl|> That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy <|nl|> To this their late escape. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> No, by my life. <|nl|> Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you, <|nl|> When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that <|nl|> You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord, <|nl|> You scarce can right me throughly then to say <|nl|> You did mistake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> No; if I mistake <|nl|> In those foundations which I build upon, <|nl|> The centre is not big enough to bear <|nl|> A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison! <|nl|> He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty <|nl|> But that he speaks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> There's some ill planet reigns: <|nl|> I must be patient till the heavens look <|nl|> With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords, <|nl|> I am not prone to weeping, as our sex <|nl|> Commonly are; the want of which vain dew <|nl|> Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have <|nl|> That honourable grief lodged here which burns <|nl|> Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords, <|nl|> With thoughts so qualified as your charities <|nl|> Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so <|nl|> The king's will be perform'd! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Shall I be heard? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness, <|nl|> My women may be with me; for you see <|nl|> My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools; <|nl|> There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress <|nl|> Has deserved prison, then abound in tears <|nl|> As I come out: this action I now go on <|nl|> Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord: <|nl|> I never wish'd to see you sorry; now <|nl|> I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Go, do our bidding; hence! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> Beseech your highness, call the queen again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice <|nl|> Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer, <|nl|> Yourself, your queen, your son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> For her, my lord, <|nl|> I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir, <|nl|> Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless <|nl|> I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean, <|nl|> In this which you accuse her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> If it prove <|nl|> She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where <|nl|> I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her; <|nl|> Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her; <|nl|> For every inch of woman in the world, <|nl|> Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Hold your peaces. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> Good my lord,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> It is for you we speak, not for ourselves: <|nl|> You are abused and by some putter-on <|nl|> That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain, <|nl|> I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd, <|nl|> I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven <|nl|> The second and the third, nine, and some five; <|nl|> If this prove true, they'll pay for't: <|nl|> by mine honour, <|nl|> I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see, <|nl|> To bring false generations: they are co-heirs; <|nl|> And I had rather glib myself than they <|nl|> Should not produce fair issue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Cease; no more. <|nl|> You smell this business with a sense as cold <|nl|> As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't <|nl|> As you feel doing thus; and see withal <|nl|> The instruments that feel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> If it be so, <|nl|> We need no grave to bury honesty: <|nl|> There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten <|nl|> Of the whole dungy earth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> What! lack I credit? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> I had rather you did lack than I, my lord, <|nl|> Upon this ground; and more it would content me <|nl|> To have her honour true than your suspicion, <|nl|> Be blamed for't how you might. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Why, what need we <|nl|> Commune with you of this, but rather follow <|nl|> Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative <|nl|> Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness <|nl|> Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied <|nl|> Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not <|nl|> Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves <|nl|> We need no more of your advice: the matter, <|nl|> The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all <|nl|> Properly ours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> And I wish, my liege, <|nl|> You had only in your silent judgment tried it, <|nl|> Without more overture. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> How could that be? <|nl|> Either thou art most ignorant by age, <|nl|> Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight, <|nl|> Added to their familiarity, <|nl|> Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture, <|nl|> That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation <|nl|> But only seeing, all other circumstances <|nl|> Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding: <|nl|> Yet, for a greater confirmation, <|nl|> For in an act of this importance 'twere <|nl|> Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post <|nl|> To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple, <|nl|> Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know <|nl|> Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle <|nl|> They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had, <|nl|> Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> Well done, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Though I am satisfied and need no more <|nl|> Than what I know, yet shall the oracle <|nl|> Give rest to the minds of others, such as he <|nl|> Whose ignorant credulity will not <|nl|> Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good <|nl|> From our free person she should be confined, <|nl|> Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence <|nl|> Be left her to perform. Come, follow us; <|nl|> We are to speak in public; for this business <|nl|> Will raise us all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> The keeper of the prison, call to him; <|nl|> let him have knowledge who I am. <|nl|> Good lady, <|nl|> No court in Europe is too good for thee; <|nl|> What dost thou then in prison? <|nl|> Now, good sir, <|nl|> You know me, do you not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gaoler: <|nl|> For a worthy lady <|nl|> And one whom much I honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Pray you then, <|nl|> Conduct me to the queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gaoler: <|nl|> I may not, madam: <|nl|> To the contrary I have express commandment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Here's ado, <|nl|> To lock up honesty and honour from <|nl|> The access of gentle visitors! <|nl|> Is't lawful, pray you, <|nl|> To see her women? any of them? Emilia? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gaoler: <|nl|> So please you, madam, <|nl|> To put apart these your attendants, I <|nl|> Shall bring Emilia forth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I pray now, call her. <|nl|> Withdraw yourselves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gaoler: <|nl|> And, madam, <|nl|> I must be present at your conference. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Well, be't so, prithee. <|nl|> Here's such ado to make no stain a stain <|nl|> As passes colouring. <|nl|> Dear gentlewoman, <|nl|> How fares our gracious lady? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EMILIA: <|nl|> As well as one so great and so forlorn <|nl|> May hold together: on her frights and griefs, <|nl|> Which never tender lady hath born greater, <|nl|> She is something before her time deliver'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> A boy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> EMILIA: <|nl|> A daughter, and a goodly babe, <|nl|> Lusty and like to live: the queen receives <|nl|> Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner, <|nl|> I am innocent as you.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I dare be sworn <|nl|> These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king, <|nl|> beshrew them! <|nl|> He must be told on't, and he shall: the office <|nl|> Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me: <|nl|> If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister <|nl|> And never to my red-look'd anger be <|nl|> The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia, <|nl|> Commend my best obedience to the queen: <|nl|> If she dares trust me with her little babe, <|nl|> I'll show't the king and undertake to be <|nl|> Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know <|nl|> How he may soften at the sight o' the child: <|nl|> The silence often of pure innocence <|nl|> Persuades when speaking fails. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EMILIA: <|nl|> Most worthy madam, <|nl|> Your honour and your goodness is so evident <|nl|> That your free undertaking cannot miss <|nl|> A thriving issue: there is no lady living <|nl|> So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship <|nl|> To visit the next room, I'll presently <|nl|> Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer; <|nl|> Who but to-day hammer'd of this design, <|nl|> But durst not tempt a minister of honour, <|nl|> Lest she should be denied. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Tell her, Emilia. <|nl|> I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't <|nl|> As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted <|nl|> I shall do good. <|nl|>  <|nl|> EMILIA: <|nl|> Now be you blest for it! <|nl|> I'll to the queen: please you, <|nl|> come something nearer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gaoler: <|nl|> Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe, <|nl|> I know not what I shall incur to pass it, <|nl|> Having no warrant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> You need not fear it, sir: <|nl|> This child was prisoner to the womb and is <|nl|> By law and process of great nature thence <|nl|> Freed and enfranchised, not a party to <|nl|> The anger of the king nor guilty of, <|nl|> If any be, the trespass of the queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gaoler: <|nl|> I do believe it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Do not you fear: upon mine honour, <|nl|> I will stand betwixt you and danger. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness <|nl|> To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If <|nl|> The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause, <|nl|> She the adulteress; for the harlot king <|nl|> Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank <|nl|> And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she <|nl|> I can hook to me: say that she were gone, <|nl|> Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest <|nl|> Might come to me again. Who's there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> My lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> How does the boy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> He took good rest to-night; <|nl|> 'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> To see his nobleness! <|nl|> Conceiving the dishonour of his mother, <|nl|> He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply, <|nl|> Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself, <|nl|> Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep, <|nl|> And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go, <|nl|> See how he fares. <|nl|> Fie, fie! no thought of him: <|nl|> The thought of my revenges that way <|nl|> Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty, <|nl|> And in his parties, his alliance; let him be <|nl|> Until a time may serve: for present vengeance, <|nl|> Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes <|nl|> Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow: <|nl|> They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor <|nl|> Shall she within my power. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> You must not enter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me: <|nl|> Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas, <|nl|> Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul, <|nl|> More free than he is jealous. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> That's enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded <|nl|> None should come at him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Not so hot, good sir: <|nl|> I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you, <|nl|> That creep like shadows by him and do sigh <|nl|> At each his needless heavings, such as you <|nl|> Nourish the cause of his awaking: I <|nl|> Do come with words as medicinal as true, <|nl|> Honest as either, to purge him of that humour <|nl|> That presses him from sleep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> What noise there, ho? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> No noise, my lord; but needful conference <|nl|> About some gossips for your highness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> How! <|nl|> Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus, <|nl|> I charged thee that she should not come about me: <|nl|> I knew she would. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> I told her so, my lord, <|nl|> On your displeasure's peril and on mine, <|nl|> She should not visit you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> What, canst not rule her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> From all dishonesty he can: in this, <|nl|> Unless he take the course that you have done, <|nl|> Commit me for committing honour, trust it, <|nl|> He shall not rule me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> La you now, you hear: <|nl|> When she will take the rein I let her run; <|nl|> But she'll not stumble. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Good my liege, I come; <|nl|> And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess <|nl|> Myself your loyal servant, your physician, <|nl|> Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare <|nl|> Less appear so in comforting your evils, <|nl|> Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come <|nl|> From your good queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Good queen! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Good queen, my lord, <|nl|> Good queen; I say good queen; <|nl|> And would by combat make her good, so were I <|nl|> A man, the worst about you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Force her hence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes <|nl|> First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off; <|nl|> But first I'll do my errand. The good queen, <|nl|> For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter; <|nl|> Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Out! <|nl|> A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door: <|nl|> A most intelligencing bawd! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Not so: <|nl|> I am as ignorant in that as you <|nl|> In so entitling me, and no less honest <|nl|> Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant, <|nl|> As this world goes, to pass for honest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Traitors! <|nl|> Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard. <|nl|> Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted <|nl|> By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard; <|nl|> Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> For ever <|nl|> Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou <|nl|> Takest up the princess by that forced baseness <|nl|> Which he has put upon't! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> He dreads his wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt <|nl|> You'ld call your children yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> A nest of traitors! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> I am none, by this good light. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Nor I, nor any <|nl|> But one that's here, and that's himself, for he <|nl|> The sacred honour of himself, his queen's, <|nl|> His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander, <|nl|> Whose sting is sharper than the sword's; <|nl|> and will not-- <|nl|> For, as the case now stands, it is a curse <|nl|> He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove <|nl|> The root of his opinion, which is rotten <|nl|> As ever oak or stone was sound. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> A callat <|nl|> Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband <|nl|> And now baits me! This brat is none of mine; <|nl|> It is the issue of Polixenes: <|nl|> Hence with it, and together with the dam <|nl|> Commit them to the fire! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> It is yours; <|nl|> And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge, <|nl|> So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords, <|nl|> Although the print be little, the whole matter <|nl|> And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip, <|nl|> The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley, <|nl|> The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, <|nl|> His smiles, <|nl|> The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger: <|nl|> And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it <|nl|> So like to him that got it, if thou hast <|nl|> The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours <|nl|> No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does, <|nl|> Her children not her husband's! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> A gross hag <|nl|> And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd, <|nl|> That wilt not stay her tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> Hang all the husbands <|nl|> That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself <|nl|> Hardly one subject. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Once more, take her hence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> A most unworthy and unnatural lord <|nl|> Can do no more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> I'll ha' thee burnt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I care not: <|nl|> It is an heretic that makes the fire, <|nl|> Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant; <|nl|> But this most cruel usage of your queen, <|nl|> Not able to produce more accusation <|nl|> Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours <|nl|> Of tyranny and will ignoble make you, <|nl|> Yea, scandalous to the world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> On your allegiance, <|nl|> Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant, <|nl|> Where were her life? she durst not call me so, <|nl|> If she did know me one. Away with her! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone. <|nl|> Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours: <|nl|> Jove send her <|nl|> A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands? <|nl|> You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies, <|nl|> Will never do him good, not one of you. <|nl|> So, so: farewell; we are gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this. <|nl|> My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast <|nl|> A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence <|nl|> And see it instantly consumed with fire; <|nl|> Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight: <|nl|> Within this hour bring me word 'tis done, <|nl|> And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life, <|nl|> With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse <|nl|> And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so; <|nl|> The bastard brains with these my proper hands <|nl|> Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire; <|nl|> For thou set'st on thy wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> I did not, sir: <|nl|> These lords, my noble fellows, if they please, <|nl|> Can clear me in't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lords: <|nl|> We can: my royal liege, <|nl|> He is not guilty of her coming hither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> You're liars all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> Beseech your highness, give us better credit: <|nl|> We have always truly served you, and beseech you <|nl|> So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg, <|nl|> As recompense of our dear services <|nl|> Past and to come, that you do change this purpose, <|nl|> Which being so horrible, so bloody, must <|nl|> Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> I am a feather for each wind that blows: <|nl|> Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel <|nl|> And call me father? better burn it now <|nl|> Than curse it then. But be it; let it live. <|nl|> It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither; <|nl|> You that have been so tenderly officious <|nl|> With Lady Margery, your midwife there, <|nl|> To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard, <|nl|> So sure as this beard's grey, <|nl|> --what will you adventure <|nl|> To save this brat's life? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> Any thing, my lord, <|nl|> That my ability may undergo <|nl|> And nobleness impose: at least thus much: <|nl|> I'll pawn the little blood which I have left <|nl|> To save the innocent: any thing possible. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> It shall be possible. Swear by this sword <|nl|> Thou wilt perform my bidding. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> I will, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail <|nl|> Of any point in't shall not only be <|nl|> Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife, <|nl|> Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee, <|nl|> As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry <|nl|> This female bastard hence and that thou bear it <|nl|> To some remote and desert place quite out <|nl|> Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it, <|nl|> Without more mercy, to its own protection <|nl|> And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune <|nl|> It came to us, I do in justice charge thee, <|nl|> On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture, <|nl|> That thou commend it strangely to some place <|nl|> Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> I swear to do this, though a present death <|nl|> Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe: <|nl|> Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens <|nl|> To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say <|nl|> Casting their savageness aside have done <|nl|> Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous <|nl|> In more than this deed does require! And blessing <|nl|> Against this cruelty fight on thy side, <|nl|> Poor thing, condemn'd to loss! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> No, I'll not rear <|nl|> Another's issue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Please your highness, posts <|nl|> From those you sent to the oracle are come <|nl|> An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion, <|nl|> Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed, <|nl|> Hasting to the court. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> So please you, sir, their speed <|nl|> Hath been beyond account. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Twenty-three days <|nl|> They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells <|nl|> The great Apollo suddenly will have <|nl|> The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords; <|nl|> Summon a session, that we may arraign <|nl|> Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath <|nl|> Been publicly accused, so shall she have <|nl|> A just and open trial. While she lives <|nl|> My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me, <|nl|> And think upon my bidding. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLEOMENES: <|nl|> The climate's delicate, the air most sweet, <|nl|> Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing <|nl|> The common praise it bears. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DION: <|nl|> I shall report, <|nl|> For most it caught me, the celestial habits, <|nl|> Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence <|nl|> Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice! <|nl|> How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly <|nl|> It was i' the offering! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLEOMENES: <|nl|> But of all, the burst <|nl|> And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle, <|nl|> Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense. <|nl|> That I was nothing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DION: <|nl|> If the event o' the journey <|nl|> Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!-- <|nl|> As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy, <|nl|> The time is worth the use on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLEOMENES: <|nl|> Great Apollo <|nl|> Turn all to the best! These proclamations, <|nl|> So forcing faults upon Hermione, <|nl|> I little like. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DION: <|nl|> The violent carriage of it <|nl|> Will clear or end the business: when the oracle, <|nl|> Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up, <|nl|> Shall the contents discover, something rare <|nl|> Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses! <|nl|> And gracious be the issue! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce, <|nl|> Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried <|nl|> The daughter of a king, our wife, and one <|nl|> Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd <|nl|> Of being tyrannous, since we so openly <|nl|> Proceed in justice, which shall have due course, <|nl|> Even to the guilt or the purgation. <|nl|> Produce the prisoner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Officer: <|nl|> It is his highness' pleasure that the queen <|nl|> Appear in person here in court. Silence! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Read the indictment. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Officer: <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Since what I am to say must be but that <|nl|> Which contradicts my accusation and <|nl|> The testimony on my part no other <|nl|> But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me <|nl|> To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity <|nl|> Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it, <|nl|> Be so received. But thus: if powers divine <|nl|> Behold our human actions, as they do, <|nl|> I doubt not then but innocence shall make <|nl|> False accusation blush and tyranny <|nl|> Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know, <|nl|> Who least will seem to do so, my past life <|nl|> Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true, <|nl|> As I am now unhappy; which is more <|nl|> Than history can pattern, though devised <|nl|> And play'd to take spectators. For behold me <|nl|> A fellow of the royal bed, which owe <|nl|> A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter, <|nl|> The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing <|nl|> To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore <|nl|> Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it <|nl|> As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour, <|nl|> 'Tis a derivative from me to mine, <|nl|> And only that I stand for. I appeal <|nl|> To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes <|nl|> Came to your court, how I was in your grace, <|nl|> How merited to be so; since he came, <|nl|> With what encounter so uncurrent I <|nl|> Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond <|nl|> The bound of honour, or in act or will <|nl|> That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts <|nl|> Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin <|nl|> Cry fie upon my grave! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> I ne'er heard yet <|nl|> That any of these bolder vices wanted <|nl|> Less impudence to gainsay what they did <|nl|> Than to perform it first. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> That's true enough; <|nl|> Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> You will not own it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> More than mistress of <|nl|> Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not <|nl|> At all acknowledge. For Polixenes, <|nl|> With whom I am accused, I do confess <|nl|> I loved him as in honour he required, <|nl|> With such a kind of love as might become <|nl|> A lady like me, with a love even such, <|nl|> So and no other, as yourself commanded: <|nl|> Which not to have done I think had been in me <|nl|> Both disobedience and ingratitude <|nl|> To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke, <|nl|> Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely <|nl|> That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy, <|nl|> I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd <|nl|> For me to try how: all I know of it <|nl|> Is that Camillo was an honest man; <|nl|> And why he left your court, the gods themselves, <|nl|> Wotting no more than I, are ignorant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> You knew of his departure, as you know <|nl|> What you have underta'en to do in's absence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Sir, <|nl|> You speak a language that I understand not: <|nl|> My life stands in the level of your dreams, <|nl|> Which I'll lay down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Your actions are my dreams; <|nl|> You had a bastard by Polixenes, <|nl|> And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,-- <|nl|> Those of your fact are so--so past all truth: <|nl|> Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as <|nl|> Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself, <|nl|> No father owning it,--which is, indeed, <|nl|> More criminal in thee than it,--so thou <|nl|> Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage <|nl|> Look for no less than death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Sir, spare your threats: <|nl|> The bug which you would fright me with I seek. <|nl|> To me can life be no commodity: <|nl|> The crown and comfort of my life, your favour, <|nl|> I do give lost; for I do feel it gone, <|nl|> But know not how it went. My second joy <|nl|> And first-fruits of my body, from his presence <|nl|> I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort <|nl|> Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast, <|nl|> The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth, <|nl|> Haled out to murder: myself on every post <|nl|> Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred <|nl|> The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs <|nl|> To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried <|nl|> Here to this place, i' the open air, before <|nl|> I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege, <|nl|> Tell me what blessings I have here alive, <|nl|> That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed. <|nl|> But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life, <|nl|> I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour, <|nl|> Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd <|nl|> Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else <|nl|> But what your jealousies awake, I tell you <|nl|> 'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all, <|nl|> I do refer me to the oracle: <|nl|> Apollo be my judge! <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> This your request <|nl|> Is altogether just: therefore bring forth, <|nl|> And in Apollos name, his oracle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> The Emperor of Russia was my father: <|nl|> O that he were alive, and here beholding <|nl|> His daughter's trial! that he did but see <|nl|> The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes <|nl|> Of pity, not revenge! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Officer: <|nl|> You here shall swear upon this sword of justice, <|nl|> That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have <|nl|> Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought <|nl|> The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd <|nl|> Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then, <|nl|> You have not dared to break the holy seal <|nl|> Nor read the secrets in't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLEOMENES: <|nl|> All this we swear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Break up the seals and read. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Officer: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lords: <|nl|> Now blessed be the great Apollo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> Praised! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Hast thou read truth? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Officer: <|nl|> Ay, my lord; even so <|nl|> As it is here set down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> There is no truth at all i' the oracle: <|nl|> The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> My lord the king, the king! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> What is the business? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> O sir, I shall be hated to report it! <|nl|> The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear <|nl|> Of the queen's speed, is gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> How! gone! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Is dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves <|nl|> Do strike at my injustice. <|nl|> How now there! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> This news is mortal to the queen: look down <|nl|> And see what death is doing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Take her hence: <|nl|> Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover: <|nl|> I have too much believed mine own suspicion: <|nl|> Beseech you, tenderly apply to her <|nl|> Some remedies for life. <|nl|> Apollo, pardon <|nl|> My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle! <|nl|> I'll reconcile me to Polixenes, <|nl|> New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo, <|nl|> Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy; <|nl|> For, being transported by my jealousies <|nl|> To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose <|nl|> Camillo for the minister to poison <|nl|> My friend Polixenes: which had been done, <|nl|> But that the good mind of Camillo tardied <|nl|> My swift command, though I with death and with <|nl|> Reward did threaten and encourage him, <|nl|> Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane <|nl|> And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest <|nl|> Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here, <|nl|> Which you knew great, and to the hazard <|nl|> Of all encertainties himself commended, <|nl|> No richer than his honour: how he glisters <|nl|> Thorough my rust! and how his pity <|nl|> Does my deeds make the blacker! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Woe the while! <|nl|> O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it, <|nl|> Break too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> What fit is this, good lady? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me? <|nl|> What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling? <|nl|> In leads or oils? what old or newer torture <|nl|> Must I receive, whose every word deserves <|nl|> To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny <|nl|> Together working with thy jealousies, <|nl|> Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle <|nl|> For girls of nine, O, think what they have done <|nl|> And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all <|nl|> Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it. <|nl|> That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing; <|nl|> That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant <|nl|> And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much, <|nl|> Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour, <|nl|> To have him kill a king: poor trespasses, <|nl|> More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon <|nl|> The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter <|nl|> To be or none or little; though a devil <|nl|> Would have shed water out of fire ere done't: <|nl|> Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death <|nl|> Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts, <|nl|> Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart <|nl|> That could conceive a gross and foolish sire <|nl|> Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no, <|nl|> Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords, <|nl|> When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen, <|nl|> The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead, <|nl|> and vengeance for't <|nl|> Not dropp'd down yet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> The higher powers forbid! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath <|nl|> Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring <|nl|> Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye, <|nl|> Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you <|nl|> As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant! <|nl|> Do not repent these things, for they are heavier <|nl|> Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee <|nl|> To nothing but despair. A thousand knees <|nl|> Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting, <|nl|> Upon a barren mountain and still winter <|nl|> In storm perpetual, could not move the gods <|nl|> To look that way thou wert. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Go on, go on <|nl|> Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved <|nl|> All tongues to talk their bitterest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Lord: <|nl|> Say no more: <|nl|> Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault <|nl|> I' the boldness of your speech. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I am sorry for't: <|nl|> All faults I make, when I shall come to know them, <|nl|> I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much <|nl|> The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd <|nl|> To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help <|nl|> Should be past grief: do not receive affliction <|nl|> At my petition; I beseech you, rather <|nl|> Let me be punish'd, that have minded you <|nl|> Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege <|nl|> Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman: <|nl|> The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!-- <|nl|> I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children; <|nl|> I'll not remember you of my own lord, <|nl|> Who is lost too: take your patience to you, <|nl|> And I'll say nothing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Thou didst speak but well <|nl|> When most the truth; which I receive much better <|nl|> Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me <|nl|> To the dead bodies of my queen and son: <|nl|> One grave shall be for both: upon them shall <|nl|> The causes of their death appear, unto <|nl|> Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit <|nl|> The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there <|nl|> Shall be my recreation: so long as nature <|nl|> Will bear up with this exercise, so long <|nl|> I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me <|nl|> Unto these sorrows. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon <|nl|> The deserts of Bohemia? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Mariner: <|nl|> Ay, my lord: and fear <|nl|> We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly <|nl|> And threaten present blusters. In my conscience, <|nl|> The heavens with that we have in hand are angry <|nl|> And frown upon 's. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard; <|nl|> Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before <|nl|> I call upon thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Mariner: <|nl|> Make your best haste, and go not <|nl|> Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather; <|nl|> Besides, this place is famous for the creatures <|nl|> Of prey that keep upon't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> Go thou away: <|nl|> I'll follow instantly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Mariner: <|nl|> I am glad at heart <|nl|> To be so rid o' the business. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTIGONUS: <|nl|> Come, poor babe: <|nl|> I have heard, but not believed, <|nl|> the spirits o' the dead <|nl|> May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother <|nl|> Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream <|nl|> So like a waking. To me comes a creature, <|nl|> Sometimes her head on one side, some another; <|nl|> I never saw a vessel of like sorrow, <|nl|> So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes, <|nl|> Like very sanctity, she did approach <|nl|> My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me, <|nl|> And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes <|nl|> Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon <|nl|> Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus, <|nl|> Since fate, against thy better disposition, <|nl|> Hath made thy person for the thrower-out <|nl|> Of my poor babe, according to thine oath, <|nl|> Places remote enough are in Bohemia, <|nl|> There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe <|nl|> Is counted lost for ever, Perdita, <|nl|> I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business <|nl|> Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see <|nl|> Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks <|nl|> She melted into air. Affrighted much, <|nl|> I did in time collect myself and thought <|nl|> This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys: <|nl|> Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously, <|nl|> I will be squared by this. I do believe <|nl|> Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that <|nl|> Apollo would, this being indeed the issue <|nl|> Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid, <|nl|> Either for life or death, upon the earth <|nl|> Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well! <|nl|> There lie, and there thy character: there these; <|nl|> Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty, <|nl|> And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch, <|nl|> That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed <|nl|> To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot, <|nl|> But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I <|nl|> To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell! <|nl|> The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have <|nl|> A lullaby too rough: I never saw <|nl|> The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour! <|nl|> Well may I get aboard! This is the chase: <|nl|> I am gone for ever. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> I would there were no age between sixteen and <|nl|> three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the <|nl|> rest; for there is nothing in the between but <|nl|> getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, <|nl|> stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but <|nl|> these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty <|nl|> hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my <|nl|> best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find <|nl|> than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by <|nl|> the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy <|nl|> will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very <|nl|> pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A <|nl|> pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape: <|nl|> though I am not bookish, yet I can read <|nl|> waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been <|nl|> some stair-work, some trunk-work, some <|nl|> behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this <|nl|> than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for <|nl|> pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed <|nl|> but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Hilloa, loa! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk <|nl|> on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What <|nl|> ailest thou, man? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land! <|nl|> but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the <|nl|> sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust <|nl|> a bodkin's point. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Why, boy, how is it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, <|nl|> how it takes up the shore! but that's not the <|nl|> point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! <|nl|> sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the <|nl|> ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon <|nl|> swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a <|nl|> cork into a hogshead. And then for the <|nl|> land-service, to see how the bear tore out his <|nl|> shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said <|nl|> his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an <|nl|> end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned <|nl|> it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the <|nl|> sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared <|nl|> and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than <|nl|> the sea or weather. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Name of mercy, when was this, boy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these <|nl|> sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor <|nl|> the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it <|nl|> now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Would I had been by, to have helped the old man! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> I would you had been by the ship side, to have <|nl|> helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here, <|nl|> boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things <|nl|> dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for <|nl|> thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's <|nl|> child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy; <|nl|> open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be <|nl|> rich by the fairies. This is some changeling: <|nl|> open't. What's within, boy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth <|nl|> are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up <|nl|> with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way. <|nl|> We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires <|nl|> nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good <|nl|> boy, the next way home. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see <|nl|> if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much <|nl|> he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they <|nl|> are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury <|nl|> it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that <|nl|> which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the <|nl|> sight of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> 'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Time: <|nl|> I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror <|nl|> Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error, <|nl|> Now take upon me, in the name of Time, <|nl|> To use my wings. Impute it not a crime <|nl|> To me or my swift passage, that I slide <|nl|> O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried <|nl|> Of that wide gap, since it is in my power <|nl|> To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour <|nl|> To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass <|nl|> The same I am, ere ancient'st order was <|nl|> Or what is now received: I witness to <|nl|> The times that brought them in; so shall I do <|nl|> To the freshest things now reigning and make stale <|nl|> The glistering of this present, as my tale <|nl|> Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing, <|nl|> I turn my glass and give my scene such growing <|nl|> As you had slept between: Leontes leaving, <|nl|> The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving <|nl|> That he shuts up himself, imagine me, <|nl|> Gentle spectators, that I now may be <|nl|> In fair Bohemia, and remember well, <|nl|> I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel <|nl|> I now name to you; and with speed so pace <|nl|> To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace <|nl|> Equal with wondering: what of her ensues <|nl|> I list not prophecy; but let Time's news <|nl|> Be known when 'tis brought forth. <|nl|> A shepherd's daughter, <|nl|> And what to her adheres, which follows after, <|nl|> Is the argument of Time. Of this allow, <|nl|> If ever you have spent time worse ere now; <|nl|> If never, yet that Time himself doth say <|nl|> He wishes earnestly you never may. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate: <|nl|> 'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to <|nl|> grant this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though <|nl|> I have for the most part been aired abroad, I <|nl|> desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent <|nl|> king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling <|nl|> sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to <|nl|> think so, which is another spur to my departure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of <|nl|> thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of <|nl|> thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to <|nl|> have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having <|nl|> made me businesses which none without thee can <|nl|> sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute <|nl|> them thyself or take away with thee the very <|nl|> services thou hast done; which if I have not enough <|nl|> considered, as too much I cannot, to be more <|nl|> thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit <|nl|> therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal <|nl|> country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very <|nl|> naming punishes me with the remembrance of that <|nl|> penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, <|nl|> my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen <|nl|> and children are even now to be afresh lamented. <|nl|> Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my <|nl|> son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not <|nl|> being gracious, than they are in losing them when <|nl|> they have approved their virtues. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What <|nl|> his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I <|nl|> have missingly noted, he is of late much retired <|nl|> from court and is less frequent to his princely <|nl|> exercises than formerly he hath appeared. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some <|nl|> care; so far that I have eyes under my service which <|nl|> look upon his removedness; from whom I have this <|nl|> intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a <|nl|> most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from <|nl|> very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his <|nl|> neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a <|nl|> daughter of most rare note: the report of her is <|nl|> extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I <|nl|> fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou <|nl|> shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not <|nl|> appearing what we are, have some question with the <|nl|> shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not <|nl|> uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither. <|nl|> Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and <|nl|> lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I willingly obey your command. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> When daffodils begin to peer, <|nl|> With heigh! the doxy over the dale, <|nl|> Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year; <|nl|> For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale. <|nl|> The white sheet bleaching on the hedge, <|nl|> With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing! <|nl|> Doth set my pugging tooth on edge; <|nl|> For a quart of ale is a dish for a king. <|nl|> The lark, that tirra-lyra chants, <|nl|> With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay, <|nl|> Are summer songs for me and my aunts, <|nl|> While we lie tumbling in the hay. <|nl|> I have served Prince Florizel and in my time <|nl|> wore three-pile; but now I am out of service: <|nl|> But shall I go mourn for that, my dear? <|nl|> The pale moon shines by night: <|nl|> And when I wander here and there, <|nl|> I then do most go right. <|nl|> If tinkers may have leave to live, <|nl|> And bear the sow-skin budget, <|nl|> Then my account I well may, give, <|nl|> And in the stocks avouch it. <|nl|> My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to <|nl|> lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who <|nl|> being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise <|nl|> a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and <|nl|> drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is <|nl|> the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful <|nl|> on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to <|nl|> me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought <|nl|> of it. A prize! a prize! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod <|nl|> yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred <|nl|> shorn. what comes the wool to? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am <|nl|> I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound <|nl|> of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will <|nl|> this sister of mine do with rice? But my father <|nl|> hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it <|nl|> on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for <|nl|> the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good <|nl|> ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but <|nl|> one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to <|nl|> horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden <|nl|> pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note; <|nl|> nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I <|nl|> may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of <|nl|> raisins o' the sun. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> O that ever I was born! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> I' the name of me-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and <|nl|> then, death, death! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay <|nl|> on thee, rather than have these off. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more <|nl|> than the stripes I have received, which are mighty <|nl|> ones and millions. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a <|nl|> great matter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel <|nl|> ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon <|nl|> me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> What, by a horseman, or a footman? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> A footman, sweet sir, a footman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he <|nl|> has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat, <|nl|> it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand, <|nl|> I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> O, good sir, tenderly, O! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Alas, poor soul! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my <|nl|> shoulder-blade is out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> How now! canst stand? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have <|nl|> a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence, <|nl|> unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or <|nl|> any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you; <|nl|> that kills my heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> What manner of fellow was he that robbed you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with <|nl|> troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the <|nl|> prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his <|nl|> virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped <|nl|> out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay <|nl|> there; and yet it will no more but abide. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he <|nl|> hath been since an ape-bearer; then a <|nl|> process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a <|nl|> motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's <|nl|> wife within a mile where my land and living lies; <|nl|> and, having flown over many knavish professions, he <|nl|> settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts <|nl|> wakes, fairs and bear-baitings. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that <|nl|> put me into this apparel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had <|nl|> but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am <|nl|> false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant <|nl|> him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> How do you now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and <|nl|> walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace <|nl|> softly towards my kinsman's. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Shall I bring thee on the way? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our <|nl|> sheep-shearing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Prosper you, sweet sir! <|nl|> Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice. <|nl|> I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I <|nl|> make not this cheat bring out another and the <|nl|> shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name <|nl|> put in the book of virtue! <|nl|> Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way, <|nl|> And merrily hent the stile-a: <|nl|> A merry heart goes all the day, <|nl|> Your sad tires in a mile-a. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> These your unusual weeds to each part of you <|nl|> Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora <|nl|> Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing <|nl|> Is as a meeting of the petty gods, <|nl|> And you the queen on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> Sir, my gracious lord, <|nl|> To chide at your extremes it not becomes me: <|nl|> O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self, <|nl|> The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured <|nl|> With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid, <|nl|> Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts <|nl|> In every mess have folly and the feeders <|nl|> Digest it with a custom, I should blush <|nl|> To see you so attired, sworn, I think, <|nl|> To show myself a glass. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> I bless the time <|nl|> When my good falcon made her flight across <|nl|> Thy father's ground. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> Now Jove afford you cause! <|nl|> To me the difference forges dread; your greatness <|nl|> Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble <|nl|> To think your father, by some accident, <|nl|> Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates! <|nl|> How would he look, to see his work so noble <|nl|> Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how <|nl|> Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold <|nl|> The sternness of his presence? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Apprehend <|nl|> Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves, <|nl|> Humbling their deities to love, have taken <|nl|> The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter <|nl|> Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune <|nl|> A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god, <|nl|> Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain, <|nl|> As I seem now. Their transformations <|nl|> Were never for a piece of beauty rarer, <|nl|> Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires <|nl|> Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts <|nl|> Burn hotter than my faith. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> O, but, sir, <|nl|> Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis <|nl|> Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king: <|nl|> One of these two must be necessities, <|nl|> Which then will speak, that you must <|nl|> change this purpose, <|nl|> Or I my life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Thou dearest Perdita, <|nl|> With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not <|nl|> The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair, <|nl|> Or not my father's. For I cannot be <|nl|> Mine own, nor any thing to any, if <|nl|> I be not thine. To this I am most constant, <|nl|> Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle; <|nl|> Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing <|nl|> That you behold the while. Your guests are coming: <|nl|> Lift up your countenance, as it were the day <|nl|> Of celebration of that nuptial which <|nl|> We two have sworn shall come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> O lady Fortune, <|nl|> Stand you auspicious! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> See, your guests approach: <|nl|> Address yourself to entertain them sprightly, <|nl|> And let's be red with mirth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon <|nl|> This day she was both pantler, butler, cook, <|nl|> Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all; <|nl|> Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here, <|nl|> At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle; <|nl|> On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire <|nl|> With labour and the thing she took to quench it, <|nl|> She would to each one sip. You are retired, <|nl|> As if you were a feasted one and not <|nl|> The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid <|nl|> These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is <|nl|> A way to make us better friends, more known. <|nl|> Come, quench your blushes and present yourself <|nl|> That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on, <|nl|> And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing, <|nl|> As your good flock shall prosper. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Shepherdess, <|nl|> A fair one are you--well you fit our ages <|nl|> With flowers of winter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> Sir, the year growing ancient, <|nl|> Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth <|nl|> Of trembling winter, the fairest <|nl|> flowers o' the season <|nl|> Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors, <|nl|> Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind <|nl|> Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not <|nl|> To get slips of them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Wherefore, gentle maiden, <|nl|> Do you neglect them? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> For I have heard it said <|nl|> There is an art which in their piedness shares <|nl|> With great creating nature. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Say there be; <|nl|> Yet nature is made better by no mean <|nl|> But nature makes that mean: so, over that art <|nl|> Which you say adds to nature, is an art <|nl|> That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry <|nl|> A gentler scion to the wildest stock, <|nl|> And make conceive a bark of baser kind <|nl|> By bud of nobler race: this is an art <|nl|> Which does mend nature, change it rather, but <|nl|> The art itself is nature. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> So it is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Then make your garden rich in gillyvors, <|nl|> And do not call them bastards. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> I'll not put <|nl|> The dibble in earth to set one slip of them; <|nl|> No more than were I painted I would wish <|nl|> This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore <|nl|> Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you; <|nl|> Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram; <|nl|> The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun <|nl|> And with him rises weeping: these are flowers <|nl|> Of middle summer, and I think they are given <|nl|> To men of middle age. You're very welcome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I should leave grazing, were I of your flock, <|nl|> And only live by gazing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> Out, alas! <|nl|> You'd be so lean, that blasts of January <|nl|> Would blow you through and through. <|nl|> Now, my fair'st friend, <|nl|> I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might <|nl|> Become your time of day; and yours, and yours, <|nl|> That wear upon your virgin branches yet <|nl|> Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina, <|nl|> For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall <|nl|> From Dis's waggon! daffodils, <|nl|> That come before the swallow dares, and take <|nl|> The winds of March with beauty; violets dim, <|nl|> But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes <|nl|> Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses <|nl|> That die unmarried, ere they can behold <|nl|> Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady <|nl|> Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and <|nl|> The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds, <|nl|> The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack, <|nl|> To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend, <|nl|> To strew him o'er and o'er! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> What, like a corse? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> No, like a bank for love to lie and play on; <|nl|> Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried, <|nl|> But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers: <|nl|> Methinks I play as I have seen them do <|nl|> In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine <|nl|> Does change my disposition. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> What you do <|nl|> Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet. <|nl|> I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing, <|nl|> I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms, <|nl|> Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs, <|nl|> To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you <|nl|> A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do <|nl|> Nothing but that; move still, still so, <|nl|> And own no other function: each your doing, <|nl|> So singular in each particular, <|nl|> Crowns what you are doing in the present deed, <|nl|> That all your acts are queens. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> O Doricles, <|nl|> Your praises are too large: but that your youth, <|nl|> And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't, <|nl|> Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd, <|nl|> With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles, <|nl|> You woo'd me the false way. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> I think you have <|nl|> As little skill to fear as I have purpose <|nl|> To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray: <|nl|> Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair, <|nl|> That never mean to part. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> I'll swear for 'em. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever <|nl|> Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems <|nl|> But smacks of something greater than herself, <|nl|> Too noble for this place. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> He tells her something <|nl|> That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is <|nl|> The queen of curds and cream. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Come on, strike up! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic, <|nl|> To mend her kissing with! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> Now, in good time! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners. <|nl|> Come, strike up! <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this <|nl|> Which dances with your daughter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> They call him Doricles; and boasts himself <|nl|> To have a worthy feeding: but I have it <|nl|> Upon his own report and I believe it; <|nl|> He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter: <|nl|> I think so too; for never gazed the moon <|nl|> Upon the water as he'll stand and read <|nl|> As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain. <|nl|> I think there is not half a kiss to choose <|nl|> Who loves another best. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> She dances featly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> So she does any thing; though I report it, <|nl|> That should be silent: if young Doricles <|nl|> Do light upon her, she shall bring him that <|nl|> Which he not dreams of. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the <|nl|> door, you would never dance again after a tabour and <|nl|> pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings <|nl|> several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he <|nl|> utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's <|nl|> ears grew to his tunes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> He could never come better; he shall come in. I <|nl|> love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful <|nl|> matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing <|nl|> indeed and sung lamentably. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no <|nl|> milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he <|nl|> has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without <|nl|> bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate <|nl|> burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump <|nl|> her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would, <|nl|> as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into <|nl|> the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me <|nl|> no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with <|nl|> 'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> This is a brave fellow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited <|nl|> fellow. Has he any unbraided wares? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow; <|nl|> points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can <|nl|> learnedly handle, though they come to him by the <|nl|> gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he <|nl|> sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you <|nl|> would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants <|nl|> to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> You have of these pedlars, that have more in them <|nl|> than you'ld think, sister. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> Ay, good brother, or go about to think. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Lawn as white as driven snow; <|nl|> Cyprus black as e'er was crow; <|nl|> Gloves as sweet as damask roses; <|nl|> Masks for faces and for noses; <|nl|> Bugle bracelet, necklace amber, <|nl|> Perfume for a lady's chamber; <|nl|> Golden quoifs and stomachers, <|nl|> For my lads to give their dears: <|nl|> Pins and poking-sticks of steel, <|nl|> What maids lack from head to heel: <|nl|> Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy; <|nl|> Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take <|nl|> no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it <|nl|> will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> I was promised them against the feast; but they come <|nl|> not too late now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has <|nl|> paid you more, which will shame you to give him again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Is there no manners left among maids? will they <|nl|> wear their plackets where they should bear their <|nl|> faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are <|nl|> going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these <|nl|> secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all <|nl|> our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour <|nl|> your tongues, and not a word more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace <|nl|> and a pair of sweet gloves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way <|nl|> and lost all my money? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; <|nl|> therefore it behoves men to be wary. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> What hast here? ballads? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o' <|nl|> life, for then we are sure they are true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's <|nl|> wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a <|nl|> burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and <|nl|> toads carbonadoed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> Is it true, think you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Very true, and but a month old. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> Bless me from marrying a usurer! <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress <|nl|> Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were <|nl|> present. Why should I carry lies abroad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> Pray you now, buy it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe <|nl|> ballads; we'll buy the other things anon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon <|nl|> the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April, <|nl|> forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this <|nl|> ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was <|nl|> thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold <|nl|> fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that <|nl|> loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> Is it true too, think you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than <|nl|> my pack will hold. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Lay it by too: another. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> Let's have some merry ones. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to <|nl|> the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's <|nl|> scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in <|nl|> request, I can tell you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou <|nl|> shalt hear; 'tis in three parts. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> We had the tune on't a month ago. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my <|nl|> occupation; have at it with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Get you hence, for I must go <|nl|> Where it fits not you to know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> Whither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> O, whither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> Whither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> It becomes thy oath full well, <|nl|> Thou to me thy secrets tell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> Me too, let me go thither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> Or thou goest to the orange or mill. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> If to either, thou dost ill. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Neither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> What, neither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Neither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DORCAS: <|nl|> Thou hast sworn my love to be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MOPSA: <|nl|> Thou hast sworn it more to me: <|nl|> Then whither goest? say, whither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my <|nl|> father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll <|nl|> not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after <|nl|> me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's <|nl|> have the first choice. Follow me, girls. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> And you shall pay well for 'em. <|nl|> Will you buy any tape, <|nl|> Or lace for your cape, <|nl|> My dainty duck, my dear-a? <|nl|> Any silk, any thread, <|nl|> Any toys for your head, <|nl|> Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a? <|nl|> Come to the pedlar; <|nl|> Money's a medler. <|nl|> That doth utter all men's ware-a. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Master, there is three carters, three shepherds, <|nl|> three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made <|nl|> themselves all men of hair, they call themselves <|nl|> Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches <|nl|> say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are <|nl|> not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it <|nl|> be not too rough for some that know little but <|nl|> bowling, it will please plentifully. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much <|nl|> homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see <|nl|> these four threes of herdsmen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath <|nl|> danced before the king; and not the worst of the <|nl|> three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Leave your prating: since these good men are <|nl|> pleased, let them come in; but quickly now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Why, they stay at door, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter. <|nl|> Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them. <|nl|> He's simple and tells much. <|nl|> How now, fair shepherd! <|nl|> Your heart is full of something that does take <|nl|> Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young <|nl|> And handed love as you do, I was wont <|nl|> To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd <|nl|> The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it <|nl|> To her acceptance; you have let him go <|nl|> And nothing marted with him. If your lass <|nl|> Interpretation should abuse and call this <|nl|> Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited <|nl|> For a reply, at least if you make a care <|nl|> Of happy holding her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Old sir, I know <|nl|> She prizes not such trifles as these are: <|nl|> The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd <|nl|> Up in my heart; which I have given already, <|nl|> But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life <|nl|> Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem, <|nl|> Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand, <|nl|> As soft as dove's down and as white as it, <|nl|> Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd <|nl|> snow that's bolted <|nl|> By the northern blasts twice o'er. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> What follows this? <|nl|> How prettily the young swain seems to wash <|nl|> The hand was fair before! I have put you out: <|nl|> But to your protestation; let me hear <|nl|> What you profess. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Do, and be witness to 't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> And this my neighbour too? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> And he, and more <|nl|> Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all: <|nl|> That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch, <|nl|> Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth <|nl|> That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge <|nl|> More than was ever man's, I would not prize them <|nl|> Without her love; for her employ them all; <|nl|> Commend them and condemn them to her service <|nl|> Or to their own perdition. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Fairly offer'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> This shows a sound affection. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> But, my daughter, <|nl|> Say you the like to him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> I cannot speak <|nl|> So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better: <|nl|> By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out <|nl|> The purity of his. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Take hands, a bargain! <|nl|> And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't: <|nl|> I give my daughter to him, and will make <|nl|> Her portion equal his. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> O, that must be <|nl|> I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead, <|nl|> I shall have more than you can dream of yet; <|nl|> Enough then for your wonder. But, come on, <|nl|> Contract us 'fore these witnesses. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Come, your hand; <|nl|> And, daughter, yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you; <|nl|> Have you a father? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> I have: but what of him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Knows he of this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> He neither does nor shall. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Methinks a father <|nl|> Is at the nuptial of his son a guest <|nl|> That best becomes the table. Pray you once more, <|nl|> Is not your father grown incapable <|nl|> Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid <|nl|> With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear? <|nl|> Know man from man? dispute his own estate? <|nl|> Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing <|nl|> But what he did being childish? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> No, good sir; <|nl|> He has his health and ampler strength indeed <|nl|> Than most have of his age. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> By my white beard, <|nl|> You offer him, if this be so, a wrong <|nl|> Something unfilial: reason my son <|nl|> Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason <|nl|> The father, all whose joy is nothing else <|nl|> But fair posterity, should hold some counsel <|nl|> In such a business. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> I yield all this; <|nl|> But for some other reasons, my grave sir, <|nl|> Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint <|nl|> My father of this business. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Let him know't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> He shall not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Prithee, let him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> No, he must not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve <|nl|> At knowing of thy choice. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Come, come, he must not. <|nl|> Mark our contract. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Mark your divorce, young sir, <|nl|> Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base <|nl|> To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir, <|nl|> That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor, <|nl|> I am sorry that by hanging thee I can <|nl|> But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece <|nl|> Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know <|nl|> The royal fool thou copest with,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> O, my heart! <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made <|nl|> More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy, <|nl|> If I may ever know thou dost but sigh <|nl|> That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never <|nl|> I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession; <|nl|> Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin, <|nl|> Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words: <|nl|> Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time, <|nl|> Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee <|nl|> From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.-- <|nl|> Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too, <|nl|> That makes himself, but for our honour therein, <|nl|> Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou <|nl|> These rural latches to his entrance open, <|nl|> Or hoop his body more with thy embraces, <|nl|> I will devise a death as cruel for thee <|nl|> As thou art tender to't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> Even here undone! <|nl|> I was not much afeard; for once or twice <|nl|> I was about to speak and tell him plainly, <|nl|> The selfsame sun that shines upon his court <|nl|> Hides not his visage from our cottage but <|nl|> Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone? <|nl|> I told you what would come of this: beseech you, <|nl|> Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,-- <|nl|> Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther, <|nl|> But milk my ewes and weep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Why, how now, father! <|nl|> Speak ere thou diest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> I cannot speak, nor think <|nl|> Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir! <|nl|> You have undone a man of fourscore three, <|nl|> That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea, <|nl|> To die upon the bed my father died, <|nl|> To lie close by his honest bones: but now <|nl|> Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me <|nl|> Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch, <|nl|> That knew'st this was the prince, <|nl|> and wouldst adventure <|nl|> To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone! <|nl|> If I might die within this hour, I have lived <|nl|> To die when I desire. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Why look you so upon me? <|nl|> I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd, <|nl|> But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am; <|nl|> More straining on for plucking back, not following <|nl|> My leash unwillingly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Gracious my lord, <|nl|> You know your father's temper: at this time <|nl|> He will allow no speech, which I do guess <|nl|> You do not purpose to him; and as hardly <|nl|> Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear: <|nl|> Then, till the fury of his highness settle, <|nl|> Come not before him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> I not purpose it. <|nl|> I think, Camillo? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Even he, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> How often have I told you 'twould be thus! <|nl|> How often said, my dignity would last <|nl|> But till 'twere known! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> It cannot fail but by <|nl|> The violation of my faith; and then <|nl|> Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together <|nl|> And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks: <|nl|> From my succession wipe me, father; I <|nl|> Am heir to my affection. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Be advised. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> I am, and by my fancy: if my reason <|nl|> Will thereto be obedient, I have reason; <|nl|> If not, my senses, better pleased with madness, <|nl|> Do bid it welcome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> This is desperate, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> So call it: but it does fulfil my vow; <|nl|> I needs must think it honesty. Camillo, <|nl|> Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may <|nl|> Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or <|nl|> The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides <|nl|> In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath <|nl|> To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you, <|nl|> As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend, <|nl|> When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not <|nl|> To see him any more,--cast your good counsels <|nl|> Upon his passion; let myself and fortune <|nl|> Tug for the time to come. This you may know <|nl|> And so deliver, I am put to sea <|nl|> With her whom here I cannot hold on shore; <|nl|> And most opportune to our need I have <|nl|> A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared <|nl|> For this design. What course I mean to hold <|nl|> Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor <|nl|> Concern me the reporting. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> O my lord! <|nl|> I would your spirit were easier for advice, <|nl|> Or stronger for your need. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Hark, Perdita <|nl|> I'll hear you by and by. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> He's irremoveable, <|nl|> Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if <|nl|> His going I could frame to serve my turn, <|nl|> Save him from danger, do him love and honour, <|nl|> Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia <|nl|> And that unhappy king, my master, whom <|nl|> I so much thirst to see. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Now, good Camillo; <|nl|> I am so fraught with curious business that <|nl|> I leave out ceremony. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Sir, I think <|nl|> You have heard of my poor services, i' the love <|nl|> That I have borne your father? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Very nobly <|nl|> Have you deserved: it is my father's music <|nl|> To speak your deeds, not little of his care <|nl|> To have them recompensed as thought on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Well, my lord, <|nl|> If you may please to think I love the king <|nl|> And through him what is nearest to him, which is <|nl|> Your gracious self, embrace but my direction: <|nl|> If your more ponderous and settled project <|nl|> May suffer alteration, on mine honour, <|nl|> I'll point you where you shall have such receiving <|nl|> As shall become your highness; where you may <|nl|> Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see, <|nl|> There's no disjunction to be made, but by-- <|nl|> As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her, <|nl|> And, with my best endeavours in your absence, <|nl|> Your discontenting father strive to qualify <|nl|> And bring him up to liking. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> How, Camillo, <|nl|> May this, almost a miracle, be done? <|nl|> That I may call thee something more than man <|nl|> And after that trust to thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Have you thought on <|nl|> A place whereto you'll go? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Not any yet: <|nl|> But as the unthought-on accident is guilty <|nl|> To what we wildly do, so we profess <|nl|> Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies <|nl|> Of every wind that blows. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Then list to me: <|nl|> This follows, if you will not change your purpose <|nl|> But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia, <|nl|> And there present yourself and your fair princess, <|nl|> For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes: <|nl|> She shall be habited as it becomes <|nl|> The partner of your bed. Methinks I see <|nl|> Leontes opening his free arms and weeping <|nl|> His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness, <|nl|> As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands <|nl|> Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him <|nl|> 'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one <|nl|> He chides to hell and bids the other grow <|nl|> Faster than thought or time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Worthy Camillo, <|nl|> What colour for my visitation shall I <|nl|> Hold up before him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Sent by the king your father <|nl|> To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir, <|nl|> The manner of your bearing towards him, with <|nl|> What you as from your father shall deliver, <|nl|> Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down: <|nl|> The which shall point you forth at every sitting <|nl|> What you must say; that he shall not perceive <|nl|> But that you have your father's bosom there <|nl|> And speak his very heart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> I am bound to you: <|nl|> There is some sap in this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> A cause more promising <|nl|> Than a wild dedication of yourselves <|nl|> To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain <|nl|> To miseries enough; no hope to help you, <|nl|> But as you shake off one to take another; <|nl|> Nothing so certain as your anchors, who <|nl|> Do their best office, if they can but stay you <|nl|> Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know <|nl|> Prosperity's the very bond of love, <|nl|> Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together <|nl|> Affliction alters. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> One of these is true: <|nl|> I think affliction may subdue the cheek, <|nl|> But not take in the mind. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Yea, say you so? <|nl|> There shall not at your father's house these <|nl|> seven years <|nl|> Be born another such. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> My good Camillo, <|nl|> She is as forward of her breeding as <|nl|> She is i' the rear our birth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> I cannot say 'tis pity <|nl|> She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress <|nl|> To most that teach. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> Your pardon, sir; for this <|nl|> I'll blush you thanks. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> My prettiest Perdita! <|nl|> But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo, <|nl|> Preserver of my father, now of me, <|nl|> The medicine of our house, how shall we do? <|nl|> We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son, <|nl|> Nor shall appear in Sicilia. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> My lord, <|nl|> Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes <|nl|> Do all lie there: it shall be so my care <|nl|> To have you royally appointed as if <|nl|> The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir, <|nl|> That you may know you shall not want, one word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his <|nl|> sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold <|nl|> all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a <|nl|> ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, <|nl|> knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, <|nl|> to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who <|nl|> should buy first, as if my trinkets had been <|nl|> hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer: <|nl|> by which means I saw whose purse was best in <|nl|> picture; and what I saw, to my good use I <|nl|> remembered. My clown, who wants but something to <|nl|> be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the <|nl|> wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes <|nl|> till he had both tune and words; which so drew the <|nl|> rest of the herd to me that all their other senses <|nl|> stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it <|nl|> was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a <|nl|> purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in <|nl|> chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song, <|nl|> and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this <|nl|> time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their <|nl|> festival purses; and had not the old man come in <|nl|> with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's <|nl|> son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not <|nl|> left a purse alive in the whole army. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Nay, but my letters, by this means being there <|nl|> So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> And those that you'll procure from King Leontes-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Shall satisfy your father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> Happy be you! <|nl|> All that you speak shows fair. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Who have we here? <|nl|> We'll make an instrument of this, omit <|nl|> Nothing may give us aid. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> If they have overheard me now, why, hanging. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear <|nl|> not, man; here's no harm intended to thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I am a poor fellow, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from <|nl|> thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must <|nl|> make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly, <|nl|> --thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and <|nl|> change garments with this gentleman: though the <|nl|> pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee, <|nl|> there's some boot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I am a poor fellow, sir. <|nl|> I know ye well enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half <|nl|> flayed already. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Are you in earnest, sir? <|nl|> I smell the trick on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Dispatch, I prithee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with <|nl|> conscience take it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Unbuckle, unbuckle. <|nl|> Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy <|nl|> Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself <|nl|> Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat <|nl|> And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face, <|nl|> Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken <|nl|> The truth of your own seeming; that you may-- <|nl|> For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard <|nl|> Get undescried. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> I see the play so lies <|nl|> That I must bear a part. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> No remedy. <|nl|> Have you done there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Should I now meet my father, <|nl|> He would not call me son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> Nay, you shall have no hat. <|nl|> Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Adieu, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> O Perdita, what have we twain forgot! <|nl|> Pray you, a word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Fortune speed us! <|nl|> Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> The swifter speed the better. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I understand the business, I hear it: to have an <|nl|> open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is <|nl|> necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite <|nl|> also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see <|nl|> this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. <|nl|> What an exchange had this been without boot! What <|nl|> a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do <|nl|> this year connive at us, and we may do any thing <|nl|> extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of <|nl|> iniquity, stealing away from his father with his <|nl|> clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of <|nl|> honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not <|nl|> do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it; <|nl|> and therein am I constant to my profession. <|nl|> Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain: <|nl|> every lane's end, every shop, church, session, <|nl|> hanging, yields a careful man work. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> See, see; what a man you are now! <|nl|> There is no other way but to tell the king <|nl|> she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Nay, but hear me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Nay, but hear me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Go to, then. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh <|nl|> and blood has not offended the king; and so your <|nl|> flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show <|nl|> those things you found about her, those secret <|nl|> things, all but what she has with her: this being <|nl|> done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his <|nl|> son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man, <|nl|> neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make <|nl|> me the king's brother-in-law. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you <|nl|> could have been to him and then your blood had been <|nl|> the dearer by I know how much an ounce. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Well, let us to the king: there is that in this <|nl|> fardel will make him scratch his beard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Pray heartily he be at palace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> To the palace, an it like your worship. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition <|nl|> of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your <|nl|> names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any <|nl|> thing that is fitting to be known, discover. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> We are but plain fellows, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no <|nl|> lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they <|nl|> often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for <|nl|> it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore <|nl|> they do not give us the lie. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Your worship had like to have given us one, if you <|nl|> had not taken yourself with the manner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest <|nl|> thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? <|nl|> hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? <|nl|> receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I <|nl|> not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou, <|nl|> for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy <|nl|> business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier <|nl|> cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck <|nl|> back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to <|nl|> open thy affair. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> My business, sir, is to the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> What advocate hast thou to him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> I know not, an't like you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you <|nl|> have none. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> How blessed are we that are not simple men! <|nl|> Yet nature might have made me as these are, <|nl|> Therefore I will not disdain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> This cannot be but a great courtier. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> His garments are rich, but he wears <|nl|> them not handsomely. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical: <|nl|> a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking <|nl|> on's teeth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> The fardel there? what's i' the fardel? <|nl|> Wherefore that box? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box, <|nl|> which none must know but the king; and which he <|nl|> shall know within this hour, if I may come to the <|nl|> speech of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Age, thou hast lost thy labour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Why, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a <|nl|> new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for, <|nl|> if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must <|nl|> know the king is full of grief. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepard: <|nl|> So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have <|nl|> married a shepherd's daughter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly: <|nl|> the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall <|nl|> feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Think you so, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy <|nl|> and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to <|nl|> him, though removed fifty times, shall all come <|nl|> under the hangman: which though it be great pity, <|nl|> yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a <|nl|> ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into <|nl|> grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death <|nl|> is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a <|nl|> sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't <|nl|> like you, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then <|nl|> 'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a <|nl|> wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters <|nl|> and a dram dead; then recovered again with <|nl|> aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as <|nl|> he is, and in the hottest day prognostication <|nl|> proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the <|nl|> sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he <|nl|> is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what <|nl|> talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries <|nl|> are to be smiled at, their offences being so <|nl|> capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain <|nl|> men, what you have to the king: being something <|nl|> gently considered, I'll bring you where he is <|nl|> aboard, tender your persons to his presence, <|nl|> whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man <|nl|> besides the king to effect your suits, here is man <|nl|> shall do it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> He seems to be of great authority: close with him, <|nl|> give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn <|nl|> bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show <|nl|> the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, <|nl|> and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for <|nl|> us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much <|nl|> more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> After I have done what I promised? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Ay, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful <|nl|> one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him, <|nl|> he'll be made an example. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show <|nl|> our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your <|nl|> daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I <|nl|> will give you as much as this old man does when the <|nl|> business is performed, and remain, as he says, your <|nl|> pawn till it be brought you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; <|nl|> go on the right hand: I will but look upon the <|nl|> hedge and follow you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would <|nl|> not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am <|nl|> courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means <|nl|> to do the prince my master good; which who knows how <|nl|> that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring <|nl|> these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he <|nl|> think it fit to shore them again and that the <|nl|> complaint they have to the king concerns him <|nl|> nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far <|nl|> officious; for I am proof against that title and <|nl|> what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present <|nl|> them: there may be matter in it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLEOMENES: <|nl|> Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd <|nl|> A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make, <|nl|> Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down <|nl|> More penitence than done trespass: at the last, <|nl|> Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil; <|nl|> With them forgive yourself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Whilst I remember <|nl|> Her and her virtues, I cannot forget <|nl|> My blemishes in them, and so still think of <|nl|> The wrong I did myself; which was so much, <|nl|> That heirless it hath made my kingdom and <|nl|> Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man <|nl|> Bred his hopes out of. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> True, too true, my lord: <|nl|> If, one by one, you wedded all the world, <|nl|> Or from the all that are took something good, <|nl|> To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd <|nl|> Would be unparallel'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> I think so. Kill'd! <|nl|> She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me <|nl|> Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter <|nl|> Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now, <|nl|> Say so but seldom. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLEOMENES: <|nl|> Not at all, good lady: <|nl|> You might have spoken a thousand things that would <|nl|> Have done the time more benefit and graced <|nl|> Your kindness better. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> You are one of those <|nl|> Would have him wed again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DION: <|nl|> If you would not so, <|nl|> You pity not the state, nor the remembrance <|nl|> Of his most sovereign name; consider little <|nl|> What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue, <|nl|> May drop upon his kingdom and devour <|nl|> Incertain lookers on. What were more holy <|nl|> Than to rejoice the former queen is well? <|nl|> What holier than, for royalty's repair, <|nl|> For present comfort and for future good, <|nl|> To bless the bed of majesty again <|nl|> With a sweet fellow to't? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> There is none worthy, <|nl|> Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods <|nl|> Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes; <|nl|> For has not the divine Apollo said, <|nl|> Is't not the tenor of his oracle, <|nl|> That King Leontes shall not have an heir <|nl|> Till his lost child be found? which that it shall, <|nl|> Is all as monstrous to our human reason <|nl|> As my Antigonus to break his grave <|nl|> And come again to me; who, on my life, <|nl|> Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel <|nl|> My lord should to the heavens be contrary, <|nl|> Oppose against their wills. <|nl|> Care not for issue; <|nl|> The crown will find an heir: great Alexander <|nl|> Left his to the worthiest; so his successor <|nl|> Was like to be the best. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Good Paulina, <|nl|> Who hast the memory of Hermione, <|nl|> I know, in honour, O, that ever I <|nl|> Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now, <|nl|> I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes, <|nl|> Have taken treasure from her lips-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> And left them <|nl|> More rich for what they yielded. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Thou speak'st truth. <|nl|> No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse, <|nl|> And better used, would make her sainted spirit <|nl|> Again possess her corpse, and on this stage, <|nl|> Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd, <|nl|> And begin, 'Why to me?' <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Had she such power, <|nl|> She had just cause. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> She had; and would incense me <|nl|> To murder her I married. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I should so. <|nl|> Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark <|nl|> Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't <|nl|> You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears <|nl|> Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd <|nl|> Should be 'Remember mine.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Stars, stars, <|nl|> And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife; <|nl|> I'll have no wife, Paulina. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Will you swear <|nl|> Never to marry but by my free leave? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLEOMENES: <|nl|> You tempt him over-much. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Unless another, <|nl|> As like Hermione as is her picture, <|nl|> Affront his eye. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLEOMENES: <|nl|> Good madam,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I have done. <|nl|> Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir, <|nl|> No remedy, but you will,--give me the office <|nl|> To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young <|nl|> As was your former; but she shall be such <|nl|> As, walk'd your first queen's ghost, <|nl|> it should take joy <|nl|> To see her in your arms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> My true Paulina, <|nl|> We shall not marry till thou bid'st us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> That <|nl|> Shall be when your first queen's again in breath; <|nl|> Never till then. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gentleman: <|nl|> One that gives out himself Prince Florizel, <|nl|> Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she <|nl|> The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access <|nl|> To your high presence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> What with him? he comes not <|nl|> Like to his father's greatness: his approach, <|nl|> So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us <|nl|> 'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced <|nl|> By need and accident. What train? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gentleman: <|nl|> But few, <|nl|> And those but mean. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> His princess, say you, with him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gentleman: <|nl|> Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think, <|nl|> That e'er the sun shone bright on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> O Hermione, <|nl|> As every present time doth boast itself <|nl|> Above a better gone, so must thy grave <|nl|> Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself <|nl|> Have said and writ so, but your writing now <|nl|> Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been, <|nl|> Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse <|nl|> Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd, <|nl|> To say you have seen a better. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gentleman: <|nl|> Pardon, madam: <|nl|> The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,-- <|nl|> The other, when she has obtain'd your eye, <|nl|> Will have your tongue too. This is a creature, <|nl|> Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal <|nl|> Of all professors else, make proselytes <|nl|> Of who she but bid follow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> How! not women? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Gentleman: <|nl|> Women will love her, that she is a woman <|nl|> More worth than any man; men, that she is <|nl|> The rarest of all women. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Go, Cleomenes; <|nl|> Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends, <|nl|> Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange <|nl|> He thus should steal upon us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Had our prince, <|nl|> Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd <|nl|> Well with this lord: there was not full a month <|nl|> Between their births. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st <|nl|> He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure, <|nl|> When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches <|nl|> Will bring me to consider that which may <|nl|> Unfurnish me of reason. They are come. <|nl|> Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince; <|nl|> For she did print your royal father off, <|nl|> Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one, <|nl|> Your father's image is so hit in you, <|nl|> His very air, that I should call you brother, <|nl|> As I did him, and speak of something wildly <|nl|> By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome! <|nl|> And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas! <|nl|> I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth <|nl|> Might thus have stood begetting wonder as <|nl|> You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost-- <|nl|> All mine own folly--the society, <|nl|> Amity too, of your brave father, whom, <|nl|> Though bearing misery, I desire my life <|nl|> Once more to look on him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> By his command <|nl|> Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him <|nl|> Give you all greetings that a king, at friend, <|nl|> Can send his brother: and, but infirmity <|nl|> Which waits upon worn times hath something seized <|nl|> His wish'd ability, he had himself <|nl|> The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his <|nl|> Measured to look upon you; whom he loves-- <|nl|> He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres <|nl|> And those that bear them living. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> O my brother, <|nl|> Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir <|nl|> Afresh within me, and these thy offices, <|nl|> So rarely kind, are as interpreters <|nl|> Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither, <|nl|> As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too <|nl|> Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage, <|nl|> At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune, <|nl|> To greet a man not worth her pains, much less <|nl|> The adventure of her person? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Good my lord, <|nl|> She came from Libya. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Where the warlike Smalus, <|nl|> That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter <|nl|> His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence, <|nl|> A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd, <|nl|> To execute the charge my father gave me <|nl|> For visiting your highness: my best train <|nl|> I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd; <|nl|> Who for Bohemia bend, to signify <|nl|> Not only my success in Libya, sir, <|nl|> But my arrival and my wife's in safety <|nl|> Here where we are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> The blessed gods <|nl|> Purge all infection from our air whilst you <|nl|> Do climate here! You have a holy father, <|nl|> A graceful gentleman; against whose person, <|nl|> So sacred as it is, I have done sin: <|nl|> For which the heavens, taking angry note, <|nl|> Have left me issueless; and your father's blest, <|nl|> As he from heaven merits it, with you <|nl|> Worthy his goodness. What might I have been, <|nl|> Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on, <|nl|> Such goodly things as you! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Most noble sir, <|nl|> That which I shall report will bear no credit, <|nl|> Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir, <|nl|> Bohemia greets you from himself by me; <|nl|> Desires you to attach his son, who has-- <|nl|> His dignity and duty both cast off-- <|nl|> Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with <|nl|> A shepherd's daughter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Where's Bohemia? speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Here in your city; I now came from him: <|nl|> I speak amazedly; and it becomes <|nl|> My marvel and my message. To your court <|nl|> Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems, <|nl|> Of this fair couple, meets he on the way <|nl|> The father of this seeming lady and <|nl|> Her brother, having both their country quitted <|nl|> With this young prince. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Camillo has betray'd me; <|nl|> Whose honour and whose honesty till now <|nl|> Endured all weathers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Lay't so to his charge: <|nl|> He's with the king your father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Who? Camillo? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now <|nl|> Has these poor men in question. Never saw I <|nl|> Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth; <|nl|> Forswear themselves as often as they speak: <|nl|> Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them <|nl|> With divers deaths in death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> O my poor father! <|nl|> The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have <|nl|> Our contract celebrated. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> You are married? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> We are not, sir, nor are we like to be; <|nl|> The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first: <|nl|> The odds for high and low's alike. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> My lord, <|nl|> Is this the daughter of a king? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> She is, <|nl|> When once she is my wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> That 'once' I see by your good father's speed <|nl|> Will come on very slowly. I am sorry, <|nl|> Most sorry, you have broken from his liking <|nl|> Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry <|nl|> Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty, <|nl|> That you might well enjoy her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FLORIZEL: <|nl|> Dear, look up: <|nl|> Though Fortune, visible an enemy, <|nl|> Should chase us with my father, power no jot <|nl|> Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir, <|nl|> Remember since you owed no more to time <|nl|> Than I do now: with thought of such affections, <|nl|> Step forth mine advocate; at your request <|nl|> My father will grant precious things as trifles. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress, <|nl|> Which he counts but a trifle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Sir, my liege, <|nl|> Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month <|nl|> 'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes <|nl|> Than what you look on now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> I thought of her, <|nl|> Even in these looks I made. <|nl|> But your petition <|nl|> Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father: <|nl|> Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires, <|nl|> I am friend to them and you: upon which errand <|nl|> I now go toward him; therefore follow me <|nl|> And mark what way I make: come, good my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old <|nl|> shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: <|nl|> whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all <|nl|> commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I <|nl|> heard the shepherd say, he found the child. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I would most gladly know the issue of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> I make a broken delivery of the business; but the <|nl|> changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were <|nl|> very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with <|nl|> staring on one another, to tear the cases of their <|nl|> eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language <|nl|> in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard <|nl|> of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable <|nl|> passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest <|nl|> beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not <|nl|> say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the <|nl|> extremity of the one, it must needs be. <|nl|> Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. <|nl|> The news, Rogero? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the <|nl|> king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is <|nl|> broken out within this hour that ballad-makers <|nl|> cannot be able to express it. <|nl|> Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can <|nl|> deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news <|nl|> which is called true is so like an old tale, that <|nl|> the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king <|nl|> found his heir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Gentleman: <|nl|> Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by <|nl|> circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you <|nl|> see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle <|nl|> of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it, <|nl|> the letters of Antigonus found with it which they <|nl|> know to be his character, the majesty of the <|nl|> creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection <|nl|> of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, <|nl|> and many other evidences proclaim her with all <|nl|> certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see <|nl|> the meeting of the two kings? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> No. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Gentleman: <|nl|> Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen, <|nl|> cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one <|nl|> joy crown another, so and in such manner that it <|nl|> seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their <|nl|> joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, <|nl|> holding up of hands, with countenances of such <|nl|> distraction that they were to be known by garment, <|nl|> not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of <|nl|> himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that <|nl|> joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother, <|nl|> thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then <|nl|> embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his <|nl|> daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old <|nl|> shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten <|nl|> conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such <|nl|> another encounter, which lames report to follow it <|nl|> and undoes description to do it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried <|nl|> hence the child? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Gentleman: <|nl|> Like an old tale still, which will have matter to <|nl|> rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear <|nl|> open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this <|nl|> avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his <|nl|> innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a <|nl|> handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> What became of his bark and his followers? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Gentleman: <|nl|> Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and <|nl|> in the view of the shepherd: so that all the <|nl|> instruments which aided to expose the child were <|nl|> even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble <|nl|> combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in <|nl|> Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of <|nl|> her husband, another elevated that the oracle was <|nl|> fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth, <|nl|> and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin <|nl|> her to her heart that she might no more be in danger <|nl|> of losing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> The dignity of this act was worth the audience of <|nl|> kings and princes; for by such was it acted. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Gentleman: <|nl|> One of the prettiest touches of all and that which <|nl|> angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not <|nl|> the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's <|nl|> death, with the manner how she came to't bravely <|nl|> confessed and lamented by the king, how <|nl|> attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one <|nl|> sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,' <|nl|> I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my <|nl|> heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed <|nl|> colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world <|nl|> could have seen 't, the woe had been universal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> Are they returned to the court? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Gentleman: <|nl|> No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue, <|nl|> which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many <|nl|> years in doing and now newly performed by that rare <|nl|> Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself <|nl|> eternity and could put breath into his work, would <|nl|> beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her <|nl|> ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that <|nl|> they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of <|nl|> answer: thither with all greediness of affection <|nl|> are they gone, and there they intend to sup. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> I thought she had some great matter there in hand; <|nl|> for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever <|nl|> since the death of Hermione, visited that removed <|nl|> house. Shall we thither and with our company piece <|nl|> the rejoicing? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? <|nl|> every wink of an eye some new grace will be born: <|nl|> our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. <|nl|> Let's along. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, <|nl|> would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old <|nl|> man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard <|nl|> them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he <|nl|> at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter, <|nl|> so he then took her to be, who began to be much <|nl|> sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of <|nl|> weather continuing, this mystery remained <|nl|> undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I <|nl|> been the finder out of this secret, it would not <|nl|> have relished among my other discredits. <|nl|> Here come those I have done good to against my will, <|nl|> and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and <|nl|> daughters will be all gentlemen born. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me <|nl|> this other day, because I was no gentleman born. <|nl|> See you these clothes? say you see them not and <|nl|> think me still no gentleman born: you were best say <|nl|> these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the <|nl|> lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Ay, and have been so any time these four hours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> And so have I, boy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my <|nl|> father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and <|nl|> called me brother; and then the two kings called my <|nl|> father brother; and then the prince my brother and <|nl|> the princess my sister called my father father; and <|nl|> so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like <|nl|> tears that ever we shed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> We may live, son, to shed many more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so <|nl|> preposterous estate as we are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the <|nl|> faults I have committed to your worship and to give <|nl|> me your good report to the prince my master. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are <|nl|> gentlemen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Thou wilt amend thy life? <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> Ay, an it like your good worship. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou <|nl|> art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> You may say it, but not swear it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and <|nl|> franklins say it, I'll swear it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Shepherd: <|nl|> How if it be false, son? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear <|nl|> it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to <|nl|> the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and <|nl|> that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no <|nl|> tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be <|nl|> drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst <|nl|> be a tall fellow of thy hands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> AUTOLYCUS: <|nl|> I will prove so, sir, to my power. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Clown: <|nl|> Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not <|nl|> wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not <|nl|> being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings <|nl|> and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the <|nl|> queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy <|nl|> good masters. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort <|nl|> That I have had of thee! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> What, sovereign sir, <|nl|> I did not well I meant well. All my services <|nl|> You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed, <|nl|> With your crown'd brother and these your contracted <|nl|> Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit, <|nl|> It is a surplus of your grace, which never <|nl|> My life may last to answer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> O Paulina, <|nl|> We honour you with trouble: but we came <|nl|> To see the statue of our queen: your gallery <|nl|> Have we pass'd through, not without much content <|nl|> In many singularities; but we saw not <|nl|> That which my daughter came to look upon, <|nl|> The statue of her mother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> As she lived peerless, <|nl|> So her dead likeness, I do well believe, <|nl|> Excels whatever yet you look'd upon <|nl|> Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it <|nl|> Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare <|nl|> To see the life as lively mock'd as ever <|nl|> Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well. <|nl|> I like your silence, it the more shows off <|nl|> Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege, <|nl|> Comes it not something near? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Her natural posture! <|nl|> Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed <|nl|> Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she <|nl|> In thy not chiding, for she was as tender <|nl|> As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina, <|nl|> Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing <|nl|> So aged as this seems. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> O, not by much. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> So much the more our carver's excellence; <|nl|> Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her <|nl|> As she lived now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> As now she might have done, <|nl|> So much to my good comfort, as it is <|nl|> Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood, <|nl|> Even with such life of majesty, warm life, <|nl|> As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her! <|nl|> I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me <|nl|> For being more stone than it? O royal piece, <|nl|> There's magic in thy majesty, which has <|nl|> My evils conjured to remembrance and <|nl|> From thy admiring daughter took the spirits, <|nl|> Standing like stone with thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> And give me leave, <|nl|> And do not say 'tis superstition, that <|nl|> I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady, <|nl|> Dear queen, that ended when I but began, <|nl|> Give me that hand of yours to kiss. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> O, patience! <|nl|> The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on, <|nl|> Which sixteen winters cannot blow away, <|nl|> So many summers dry; scarce any joy <|nl|> Did ever so long live; no sorrow <|nl|> But kill'd itself much sooner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Dear my brother, <|nl|> Let him that was the cause of this have power <|nl|> To take off so much grief from you as he <|nl|> Will piece up in himself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Indeed, my lord, <|nl|> If I had thought the sight of my poor image <|nl|> Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine-- <|nl|> I'ld not have show'd it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Do not draw the curtain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy <|nl|> May think anon it moves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Let be, let be. <|nl|> Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already-- <|nl|> What was he that did make it? See, my lord, <|nl|> Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins <|nl|> Did verily bear blood? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Masterly done: <|nl|> The very life seems warm upon her lip. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> The fixture of her eye has motion in't, <|nl|> As we are mock'd with art. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I'll draw the curtain: <|nl|> My lord's almost so far transported that <|nl|> He'll think anon it lives. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> O sweet Paulina, <|nl|> Make me to think so twenty years together! <|nl|> No settled senses of the world can match <|nl|> The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but <|nl|> I could afflict you farther. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Do, Paulina; <|nl|> For this affliction has a taste as sweet <|nl|> As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks, <|nl|> There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel <|nl|> Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me, <|nl|> For I will kiss her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Good my lord, forbear: <|nl|> The ruddiness upon her lip is wet; <|nl|> You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own <|nl|> With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> No, not these twenty years. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PERDITA: <|nl|> So long could I <|nl|> Stand by, a looker on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Either forbear, <|nl|> Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you <|nl|> For more amazement. If you can behold it, <|nl|> I'll make the statue move indeed, descend <|nl|> And take you by the hand; but then you'll think-- <|nl|> Which I protest against--I am assisted <|nl|> By wicked powers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> What you can make her do, <|nl|> I am content to look on: what to speak, <|nl|> I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy <|nl|> To make her speak as move. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> It is required <|nl|> You do awake your faith. Then all stand still; <|nl|> On: those that think it is unlawful business <|nl|> I am about, let them depart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> Proceed: <|nl|> No foot shall stir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> Music, awake her; strike! <|nl|> 'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach; <|nl|> Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come, <|nl|> I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away, <|nl|> Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him <|nl|> Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs: <|nl|> Start not; her actions shall be holy as <|nl|> You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her <|nl|> Until you see her die again; for then <|nl|> You kill her double. Nay, present your hand: <|nl|> When she was young you woo'd her; now in age <|nl|> Is she become the suitor? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> O, she's warm! <|nl|> If this be magic, let it be an art <|nl|> Lawful as eating. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> She embraces him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CAMILLO: <|nl|> She hangs about his neck: <|nl|> If she pertain to life let her speak too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POLIXENES: <|nl|> Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived, <|nl|> Or how stolen from the dead. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> That she is living, <|nl|> Were it but told you, should be hooted at <|nl|> Like an old tale: but it appears she lives, <|nl|> Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while. <|nl|> Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel <|nl|> And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady; <|nl|> Our Perdita is found. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HERMIONE: <|nl|> You gods, look down <|nl|> And from your sacred vials pour your graces <|nl|> Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own. <|nl|> Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found <|nl|> Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I, <|nl|> Knowing by Paulina that the oracle <|nl|> Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved <|nl|> Myself to see the issue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PAULINA: <|nl|> There's time enough for that; <|nl|> Lest they desire upon this push to trouble <|nl|> Your joys with like relation. Go together, <|nl|> You precious winners all; your exultation <|nl|> Partake to every one. I, an old turtle, <|nl|> Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there <|nl|> My mate, that's never to be found again, <|nl|> Lament till I am lost. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LEONTES: <|nl|> O, peace, Paulina! <|nl|> Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent, <|nl|> As I by thine a wife: this is a match, <|nl|> And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine; <|nl|> But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her, <|nl|> As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many <|nl|> A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-- <|nl|> For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee <|nl|> An honourable husband. Come, Camillo, <|nl|> And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty <|nl|> Is richly noted and here justified <|nl|> By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place. <|nl|> What! look upon my brother: both your pardons, <|nl|> That e'er I put between your holy looks <|nl|> My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law, <|nl|> And son unto the king, who, heavens directing, <|nl|> Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina, <|nl|> Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely <|nl|> Each one demand an answer to his part <|nl|> Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first <|nl|> We were dissever'd: hastily lead away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Escalus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> My lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Of government the properties to unfold, <|nl|> Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse; <|nl|> Since I am put to know that your own science <|nl|> Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice <|nl|> My strength can give you: then no more remains, <|nl|> But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able, <|nl|> And let them work. The nature of our people, <|nl|> Our city's institutions, and the terms <|nl|> For common justice, you're as pregnant in <|nl|> As art and practise hath enriched any <|nl|> That we remember. There is our commission, <|nl|> From which we would not have you warp. Call hither, <|nl|> I say, bid come before us Angelo. <|nl|> What figure of us think you he will bear? <|nl|> For you must know, we have with special soul <|nl|> Elected him our absence to supply, <|nl|> Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love, <|nl|> And given his deputation all the organs <|nl|> Of our own power: what think you of it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> If any in Vienna be of worth <|nl|> To undergo such ample grace and honour, <|nl|> It is Lord Angelo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Look where he comes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Always obedient to your grace's will, <|nl|> I come to know your pleasure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Angelo, <|nl|> There is a kind of character in thy life, <|nl|> That to the observer doth thy history <|nl|> Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings <|nl|> Are not thine own so proper as to waste <|nl|> Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee. <|nl|> Heaven doth with us as we with torches do, <|nl|> Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues <|nl|> Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike <|nl|> As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd <|nl|> But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends <|nl|> The smallest scruple of her excellence <|nl|> But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines <|nl|> Herself the glory of a creditor, <|nl|> Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech <|nl|> To one that can my part in him advertise; <|nl|> Hold therefore, Angelo:-- <|nl|> In our remove be thou at full ourself; <|nl|> Mortality and mercy in Vienna <|nl|> Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus, <|nl|> Though first in question, is thy secondary. <|nl|> Take thy commission. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Now, good my lord, <|nl|> Let there be some more test made of my metal, <|nl|> Before so noble and so great a figure <|nl|> Be stamp'd upon it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> No more evasion: <|nl|> We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice <|nl|> Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours. <|nl|> Our haste from hence is of so quick condition <|nl|> That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd <|nl|> Matters of needful value. We shall write to you, <|nl|> As time and our concernings shall importune, <|nl|> How it goes with us, and do look to know <|nl|> What doth befall you here. So, fare you well; <|nl|> To the hopeful execution do I leave you <|nl|> Of your commissions. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Yet give leave, my lord, <|nl|> That we may bring you something on the way. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> My haste may not admit it; <|nl|> Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do <|nl|> With any scruple; your scope is as mine own <|nl|> So to enforce or qualify the laws <|nl|> As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand: <|nl|> I'll privily away. I love the people, <|nl|> But do not like to stage me to their eyes: <|nl|> Through it do well, I do not relish well <|nl|> Their loud applause and Aves vehement; <|nl|> Nor do I think the man of safe discretion <|nl|> That does affect it. Once more, fare you well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> The heavens give safety to your purposes! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Lead forth and bring you back in happiness! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE: <|nl|> I thank you. Fare you well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave <|nl|> To have free speech with you; and it concerns me <|nl|> To look into the bottom of my place: <|nl|> A power I have, but of what strength and nature <|nl|> I am not yet instructed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> 'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together, <|nl|> And we may soon our satisfaction have <|nl|> Touching that point. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I'll wait upon your honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> If the duke with the other dukes come not to <|nl|> composition with the King of Hungary, why then all <|nl|> the dukes fall upon the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of <|nl|> Hungary's! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> Amen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that <|nl|> went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped <|nl|> one out of the table. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> 'Thou shalt not steal'? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Ay, that he razed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and <|nl|> all the rest from their functions: they put forth <|nl|> to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in <|nl|> the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition <|nl|> well that prays for peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> I never heard any soldier dislike it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where <|nl|> grace was said. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> No? a dozen times at least. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> What, in metre? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> In any proportion or in any language. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> I think, or in any religion. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all <|nl|> controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a <|nl|> wicked villain, despite of all grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> Well, there went but a pair of shears between us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I grant; as there may between the lists and the <|nl|> velvet. Thou art the list. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt <|nl|> a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief <|nl|> be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou <|nl|> art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak <|nl|> feelingly now? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful <|nl|> feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own <|nl|> confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I <|nl|> live, forget to drink after thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> I think I have done myself wrong, have I not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I <|nl|> have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> To what, I pray? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Judge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> To three thousand dolours a year. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> Ay, and more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> A French crown more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou <|nl|> art full of error; I am sound. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as <|nl|> things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; <|nl|> impiety has made a feast of thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried <|nl|> to prison was worth five thousand of you all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> Who's that, I pray thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> Claudio to prison? 'tis not so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw <|nl|> him carried away; and, which is more, within these <|nl|> three days his head to be chopped off. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. <|nl|> Art thou sure of this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam <|nl|> Julietta with child. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two <|nl|> hours since, and he was ever precise in <|nl|> promise-keeping. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Gentleman: <|nl|> Besides, you know, it draws something near to the <|nl|> speech we had to such a purpose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Gentleman: <|nl|> But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Away! let's go learn the truth of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what <|nl|> with the gallows and what with poverty, I am <|nl|> custom-shrunk. <|nl|> How now! what's the news with you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Yonder man is carried to prison. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> Well; what has he done? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> A woman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> But what's his offence? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Groping for trouts in a peculiar river. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> What, is there a maid with child by him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have <|nl|> not heard of the proclamation, have you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> What proclamation, man? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> And what shall become of those in the city? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too, <|nl|> but that a wise burgher put in for them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be <|nl|> pulled down? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> To the ground, mistress. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth! <|nl|> What shall become of me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no <|nl|> clients: though you change your place, you need not <|nl|> change your trade; I'll be your tapster still. <|nl|> Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that <|nl|> have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you <|nl|> will be considered. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to <|nl|> prison; and there's Madam Juliet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world? <|nl|> Bear me to prison, where I am committed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> I do it not in evil disposition, <|nl|> But from Lord Angelo by special charge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Thus can the demigod Authority <|nl|> Make us pay down for our offence by weight <|nl|> The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will; <|nl|> On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty: <|nl|> As surfeit is the father of much fast, <|nl|> So every scope by the immoderate use <|nl|> Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue, <|nl|> Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, <|nl|> A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would <|nl|> send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say <|nl|> the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom <|nl|> as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy <|nl|> offence, Claudio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> What but to speak of would offend again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> What, is't murder? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> No. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Lechery? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Call it so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Away, sir! you must go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> A hundred, if they'll do you any good. <|nl|> Is lechery so look'd after? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract <|nl|> I got possession of Julietta's bed: <|nl|> You know the lady; she is fast my wife, <|nl|> Save that we do the denunciation lack <|nl|> Of outward order: this we came not to, <|nl|> Only for propagation of a dower <|nl|> Remaining in the coffer of her friends, <|nl|> From whom we thought it meet to hide our love <|nl|> Till time had made them for us. But it chances <|nl|> The stealth of our most mutual entertainment <|nl|> With character too gross is writ on Juliet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> With child, perhaps? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Unhappily, even so. <|nl|> And the new deputy now for the duke-- <|nl|> Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, <|nl|> Or whether that the body public be <|nl|> A horse whereon the governor doth ride, <|nl|> Who, newly in the seat, that it may know <|nl|> He can command, lets it straight feel the spur; <|nl|> Whether the tyranny be in his place, <|nl|> Or in his emmence that fills it up, <|nl|> I stagger in:--but this new governor <|nl|> Awakes me all the enrolled penalties <|nl|> Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall <|nl|> So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round <|nl|> And none of them been worn; and, for a name, <|nl|> Now puts the drowsy and neglected act <|nl|> Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on <|nl|> thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, <|nl|> may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to <|nl|> him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> I have done so, but he's not to be found. <|nl|> I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service: <|nl|> This day my sister should the cloister enter <|nl|> And there receive her approbation: <|nl|> Acquaint her with the danger of my state: <|nl|> Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends <|nl|> To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him: <|nl|> I have great hope in that; for in her youth <|nl|> There is a prone and speechless dialect, <|nl|> Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art <|nl|> When she will play with reason and discourse, <|nl|> And well she can persuade. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the <|nl|> like, which else would stand under grievous <|nl|> imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I <|nl|> would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a <|nl|> game of tick-tack. I'll to her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> I thank you, good friend Lucio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Within two hours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Come, officer, away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> No, holy father; throw away that thought; <|nl|> Believe not that the dribbling dart of love <|nl|> Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee <|nl|> To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose <|nl|> More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends <|nl|> Of burning youth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR THOMAS: <|nl|> May your grace speak of it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> My holy sir, none better knows than you <|nl|> How I have ever loved the life removed <|nl|> And held in idle price to haunt assemblies <|nl|> Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps. <|nl|> I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo, <|nl|> A man of stricture and firm abstinence, <|nl|> My absolute power and place here in Vienna, <|nl|> And he supposes me travell'd to Poland; <|nl|> For so I have strew'd it in the common ear, <|nl|> And so it is received. Now, pious sir, <|nl|> You will demand of me why I do this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR THOMAS: <|nl|> Gladly, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> We have strict statutes and most biting laws. <|nl|> The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, <|nl|> Which for this nineteen years we have let slip; <|nl|> Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave, <|nl|> That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers, <|nl|> Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch, <|nl|> Only to stick it in their children's sight <|nl|> For terror, not to use, in time the rod <|nl|> Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees, <|nl|> Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead; <|nl|> And liberty plucks justice by the nose; <|nl|> The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart <|nl|> Goes all decorum. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR THOMAS: <|nl|> It rested in your grace <|nl|> To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased: <|nl|> And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd <|nl|> Than in Lord Angelo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I do fear, too dreadful: <|nl|> Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope, <|nl|> 'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them <|nl|> For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done, <|nl|> When evil deeds have their permissive pass <|nl|> And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father, <|nl|> I have on Angelo imposed the office; <|nl|> Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home, <|nl|> And yet my nature never in the fight <|nl|> To do in slander. And to behold his sway, <|nl|> I will, as 'twere a brother of your order, <|nl|> Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee, <|nl|> Supply me with the habit and instruct me <|nl|> How I may formally in person bear me <|nl|> Like a true friar. More reasons for this action <|nl|> At our more leisure shall I render you; <|nl|> Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise; <|nl|> Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses <|nl|> That his blood flows, or that his appetite <|nl|> Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see, <|nl|> If power change purpose, what our seemers be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> And have you nuns no farther privileges? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRANCISCA: <|nl|> Are not these large enough? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more; <|nl|> But rather wishing a more strict restraint <|nl|> Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Who's that which calls? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRANCISCA: <|nl|> It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella, <|nl|> Turn you the key, and know his business of him; <|nl|> You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn. <|nl|> When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men <|nl|> But in the presence of the prioress: <|nl|> Then, if you speak, you must not show your face, <|nl|> Or, if you show your face, you must not speak. <|nl|> He calls again; I pray you, answer him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses <|nl|> Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me <|nl|> As bring me to the sight of Isabella, <|nl|> A novice of this place and the fair sister <|nl|> To her unhappy brother Claudio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask, <|nl|> The rather for I now must make you know <|nl|> I am that Isabella and his sister. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you: <|nl|> Not to be weary with you, he's in prison. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Woe me! for what? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> For that which, if myself might be his judge, <|nl|> He should receive his punishment in thanks: <|nl|> He hath got his friend with child. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Sir, make me not your story. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> It is true. <|nl|> I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin <|nl|> With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest, <|nl|> Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so: <|nl|> I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted. <|nl|> By your renouncement an immortal spirit, <|nl|> And to be talk'd with in sincerity, <|nl|> As with a saint. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> You do blaspheme the good in mocking me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus: <|nl|> Your brother and his lover have embraced: <|nl|> As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time <|nl|> That from the seedness the bare fallow brings <|nl|> To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb <|nl|> Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Is she your cousin? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names <|nl|> By vain though apt affection. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> She it is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, let him marry her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> This is the point. <|nl|> The duke is very strangely gone from hence; <|nl|> Bore many gentlemen, myself being one, <|nl|> In hand and hope of action: but we do learn <|nl|> By those that know the very nerves of state, <|nl|> His givings-out were of an infinite distance <|nl|> From his true-meant design. Upon his place, <|nl|> And with full line of his authority, <|nl|> Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood <|nl|> Is very snow-broth; one who never feels <|nl|> The wanton stings and motions of the sense, <|nl|> But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge <|nl|> With profits of the mind, study and fast. <|nl|> He--to give fear to use and liberty, <|nl|> Which have for long run by the hideous law, <|nl|> As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act, <|nl|> Under whose heavy sense your brother's life <|nl|> Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it; <|nl|> And follows close the rigour of the statute, <|nl|> To make him an example. All hope is gone, <|nl|> Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer <|nl|> To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business <|nl|> 'Twixt you and your poor brother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Doth he so seek his life? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Has censured him <|nl|> Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath <|nl|> A warrant for his execution. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Alas! what poor ability's in me <|nl|> To do him good? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Assay the power you have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> My power? Alas, I doubt-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Our doubts are traitors <|nl|> And make us lose the good we oft might win <|nl|> By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo, <|nl|> And let him learn to know, when maidens sue, <|nl|> Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel, <|nl|> All their petitions are as freely theirs <|nl|> As they themselves would owe them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I'll see what I can do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> But speedily. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I will about it straight; <|nl|> No longer staying but to give the mother <|nl|> Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you: <|nl|> Commend me to my brother: soon at night <|nl|> I'll send him certain word of my success. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I take my leave of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Good sir, adieu. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> We must not make a scarecrow of the law, <|nl|> Setting it up to fear the birds of prey, <|nl|> And let it keep one shape, till custom make it <|nl|> Their perch and not their terror. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Ay, but yet <|nl|> Let us be keen, and rather cut a little, <|nl|> Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman <|nl|> Whom I would save, had a most noble father! <|nl|> Let but your honour know, <|nl|> Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue, <|nl|> That, in the working of your own affections, <|nl|> Had time cohered with place or place with wishing, <|nl|> Or that the resolute acting of your blood <|nl|> Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose, <|nl|> Whether you had not sometime in your life <|nl|> Err'd in this point which now you censure him, <|nl|> And pull'd the law upon you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> 'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus, <|nl|> Another thing to fall. I not deny, <|nl|> The jury, passing on the prisoner's life, <|nl|> May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two <|nl|> Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice, <|nl|> That justice seizes: what know the laws <|nl|> That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant, <|nl|> The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't <|nl|> Because we see it; but what we do not see <|nl|> We tread upon, and never think of it. <|nl|> You may not so extenuate his offence <|nl|> For I have had such faults; but rather tell me, <|nl|> When I, that censure him, do so offend, <|nl|> Let mine own judgment pattern out my death, <|nl|> And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Be it as your wisdom will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Where is the provost? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Here, if it like your honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> See that Claudio <|nl|> Be executed by nine to-morrow morning: <|nl|> Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared; <|nl|> For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Come, bring them away: if these be good people in <|nl|> a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in <|nl|> common houses, I know no law: bring them away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's <|nl|> constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon <|nl|> justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good <|nl|> honour two notorious benefactors. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are <|nl|> they not malefactors? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> If it? please your honour, I know not well what they <|nl|> are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure <|nl|> of; and void of all profanation in the world that <|nl|> good Christians ought to have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> This comes off well; here's a wise officer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your <|nl|> name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> What are you, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that <|nl|> serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they <|nl|> say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she <|nl|> professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> How know you that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> How? thy wife? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Dost thou detest her therefore? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as <|nl|> she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house, <|nl|> it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> How dost thou know that, constable? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman <|nl|> cardinally given, might have been accused in <|nl|> fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> By the woman's means? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she <|nl|> spit in his face, so she defied him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable <|nl|> man; prove it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Do you hear how he misplaces? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Sir, she came in great with child; and longing, <|nl|> saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes; <|nl|> sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very <|nl|> distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a <|nl|> dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen <|nl|> such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very <|nl|> good dishes,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in <|nl|> the right: but to the point. As I say, this <|nl|> Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and <|nl|> being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for <|nl|> prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said, <|nl|> Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the <|nl|> rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very <|nl|> honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could <|nl|> not give you three-pence again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FROTH: <|nl|> No, indeed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Very well: you being then, if you be remembered, <|nl|> cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> FROTH: <|nl|> Ay, so I did indeed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be <|nl|> remembered, that such a one and such a one were past <|nl|> cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very <|nl|> good diet, as I told you,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> FROTH: <|nl|> All this is true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Why, very well, then,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What <|nl|> was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to <|nl|> complain of? Come me to what was done to her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> No, sir, nor I mean it not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's <|nl|> leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth <|nl|> here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose <|nl|> father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas, <|nl|> Master Froth? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FROTH: <|nl|> All-hallond eve. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir, <|nl|> sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in <|nl|> the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight <|nl|> to sit, have you not? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FROTH: <|nl|> I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> This will last out a night in Russia, <|nl|> When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave. <|nl|> And leave you to the hearing of the cause; <|nl|> Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship. <|nl|> Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> I beseech your honour, ask me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face. <|nl|> Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a <|nl|> good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Ay, sir, very well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Nay; I beseech you, mark it well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Well, I do so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Doth your honour see any harm in his face? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Why, no. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst <|nl|> thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the <|nl|> worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the <|nl|> constable's wife any harm? I would know that of <|nl|> your honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> First, an it like you, the house is a respected <|nl|> house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his <|nl|> mistress is a respected woman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected <|nl|> person than any of us all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the <|nl|> time has yet to come that she was ever respected <|nl|> with man, woman, or child. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is <|nl|> this true? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked <|nl|> Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married <|nl|> to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she <|nl|> with me, let not your worship think me the poor <|nl|> duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or <|nl|> I'll have mine action of battery on thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your <|nl|> action of slander too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't <|nl|> your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him <|nl|> that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him <|nl|> continue in his courses till thou knowest what they <|nl|> are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou <|nl|> wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art <|nl|> to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Where were you born, friend? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FROTH: <|nl|> Here in Vienna, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Are you of fourscore pounds a year? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FROTH: <|nl|> Yes, an't please you, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> So. What trade are you of, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPHEY: <|nl|> Tapster; a poor widow's tapster. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Your mistress' name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPHEY: <|nl|> Mistress Overdone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Hath she had any more than one husband? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Nine, sir; Overdone by the last. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master <|nl|> Froth, I would not have you acquainted with <|nl|> tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you <|nl|> will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no <|nl|> more of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FROTH: <|nl|> I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never <|nl|> come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn <|nl|> in. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell. <|nl|> Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your <|nl|> name, Master tapster? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Pompey. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> What else? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Bum, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you; <|nl|> so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the <|nl|> Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey, <|nl|> howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you <|nl|> not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What <|nl|> do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> If the law would allow it, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall <|nl|> not be allowed in Vienna. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the <|nl|> youth of the city? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> No, Pompey. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then. <|nl|> If your worship will take order for the drabs and <|nl|> the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you: <|nl|> it is but heading and hanging. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> If you head and hang all that offend that way but <|nl|> for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a <|nl|> commission for more heads: if this law hold in <|nl|> Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it <|nl|> after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this <|nl|> come to pass, say Pompey told you so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your <|nl|> prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find <|nl|> you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever; <|nl|> no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey, <|nl|> I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd <|nl|> Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall <|nl|> have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> I thank your worship for your good counsel: <|nl|> but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall <|nl|> better determine. <|nl|> Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade: <|nl|> The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master <|nl|> constable. How long have you been in this place of constable? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Seven year and a half, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had <|nl|> continued in it some time. You say, seven years together? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> And a half, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you <|nl|> wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men <|nl|> in your ward sufficient to serve it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they <|nl|> are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I <|nl|> do it for some piece of money, and go through with <|nl|> all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven, <|nl|> the most sufficient of your parish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> To your worship's house, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> To my house. Fare you well. <|nl|> What's o'clock, think you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Justice: <|nl|> Eleven, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I pray you home to dinner with me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Justice: <|nl|> I humbly thank you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> It grieves me for the death of Claudio; <|nl|> But there's no remedy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Justice: <|nl|> Lord Angelo is severe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> It is but needful: <|nl|> Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so; <|nl|> Pardon is still the nurse of second woe: <|nl|> But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy. <|nl|> Come, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight <|nl|> I'll tell him of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Pray you, do. <|nl|> I'll know <|nl|> His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas, <|nl|> He hath but as offended in a dream! <|nl|> All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he <|nl|> To die for't! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Now, what's the matter. Provost? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order? <|nl|> Why dost thou ask again? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Lest I might be too rash: <|nl|> Under your good correction, I have seen, <|nl|> When, after execution, judgment hath <|nl|> Repented o'er his doom. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Go to; let that be mine: <|nl|> Do you your office, or give up your place, <|nl|> And you shall well be spared. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> I crave your honour's pardon. <|nl|> What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet? <|nl|> She's very near her hour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Dispose of her <|nl|> To some more fitter place, and that with speed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Here is the sister of the man condemn'd <|nl|> Desires access to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Hath he a sister? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid, <|nl|> And to be shortly of a sisterhood, <|nl|> If not already. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Well, let her be admitted. <|nl|> See you the fornicatress be removed: <|nl|> Let have needful, but not lavish, means; <|nl|> There shall be order for't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> God save your honour! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Stay a little while. <|nl|> You're welcome: what's your will? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I am a woeful suitor to your honour, <|nl|> Please but your honour hear me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Well; what's your suit? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> There is a vice that most I do abhor, <|nl|> And most desire should meet the blow of justice; <|nl|> For which I would not plead, but that I must; <|nl|> For which I must not plead, but that I am <|nl|> At war 'twixt will and will not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Well; the matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I have a brother is condemn'd to die: <|nl|> I do beseech you, let it be his fault, <|nl|> And not my brother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Condemn the fault and not the actor of it? <|nl|> Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done: <|nl|> Mine were the very cipher of a function, <|nl|> To fine the faults whose fine stands in record, <|nl|> And let go by the actor. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O just but severe law! <|nl|> I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Must he needs die? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Maiden, no remedy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Yes; I do think that you might pardon him, <|nl|> And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> I will not do't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> But can you, if you would? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Look, what I will not, that I cannot do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> But might you do't, and do the world no wrong, <|nl|> If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse <|nl|> As mine is to him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> He's sentenced; 'tis too late. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word. <|nl|> May call it back again. Well, believe this, <|nl|> No ceremony that to great ones 'longs, <|nl|> Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword, <|nl|> The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe, <|nl|> Become them with one half so good a grace <|nl|> As mercy does. <|nl|> If he had been as you and you as he, <|nl|> You would have slipt like him; but he, like you, <|nl|> Would not have been so stern. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Pray you, be gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I would to heaven I had your potency, <|nl|> And you were Isabel! should it then be thus? <|nl|> No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge, <|nl|> And what a prisoner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Your brother is a forfeit of the law, <|nl|> And you but waste your words. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Alas, alas! <|nl|> Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once; <|nl|> And He that might the vantage best have took <|nl|> Found out the remedy. How would you be, <|nl|> If He, which is the top of judgment, should <|nl|> But judge you as you are? O, think on that; <|nl|> And mercy then will breathe within your lips, <|nl|> Like man new made. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Be you content, fair maid; <|nl|> It is the law, not I condemn your brother: <|nl|> Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son, <|nl|> It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him! <|nl|> He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens <|nl|> We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven <|nl|> With less respect than we do minister <|nl|> To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you; <|nl|> Who is it that hath died for this offence? <|nl|> There's many have committed it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept: <|nl|> Those many had not dared to do that evil, <|nl|> If the first that did the edict infringe <|nl|> Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake <|nl|> Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet, <|nl|> Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils, <|nl|> Either new, or by remissness new-conceived, <|nl|> And so in progress to be hatch'd and born, <|nl|> Are now to have no successive degrees, <|nl|> But, ere they live, to end. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Yet show some pity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> I show it most of all when I show justice; <|nl|> For then I pity those I do not know, <|nl|> Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall; <|nl|> And do him right that, answering one foul wrong, <|nl|> Lives not to act another. Be satisfied; <|nl|> Your brother dies to-morrow; be content. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> So you must be the first that gives this sentence, <|nl|> And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent <|nl|> To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous <|nl|> To use it like a giant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Could great men thunder <|nl|> As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet, <|nl|> For every pelting, petty officer <|nl|> Would use his heaven for thunder; <|nl|> Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven, <|nl|> Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt <|nl|> Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak <|nl|> Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man, <|nl|> Drest in a little brief authority, <|nl|> Most ignorant of what he's most assured, <|nl|> His glassy essence, like an angry ape, <|nl|> Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven <|nl|> As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens, <|nl|> Would all themselves laugh mortal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> We cannot weigh our brother with ourself: <|nl|> Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them, <|nl|> But in the less foul profanation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> That in the captain's but a choleric word, <|nl|> Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Why do you put these sayings upon me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Because authority, though it err like others, <|nl|> Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself, <|nl|> That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom; <|nl|> Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know <|nl|> That's like my brother's fault: if it confess <|nl|> A natural guiltiness such as is his, <|nl|> Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue <|nl|> Against my brother's life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Gentle my lord, turn back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> I will bethink me: come again tomorrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> How! bribe me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Not with fond shekels of the tested gold, <|nl|> Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor <|nl|> As fancy values them; but with true prayers <|nl|> That shall be up at heaven and enter there <|nl|> Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls, <|nl|> From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate <|nl|> To nothing temporal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Well; come to me to-morrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Heaven keep your honour safe! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> At what hour to-morrow <|nl|> Shall I attend your lordship? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> At any time 'fore noon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> 'Save your honour! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> From thee, even from thy virtue! <|nl|> What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine? <|nl|> The tempter or the tempted, who sins most? <|nl|> Ha! <|nl|> Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I <|nl|> That, lying by the violet in the sun, <|nl|> Do as the carrion does, not as the flower, <|nl|> Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be <|nl|> That modesty may more betray our sense <|nl|> Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough, <|nl|> Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary <|nl|> And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie! <|nl|> What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo? <|nl|> Dost thou desire her foully for those things <|nl|> That make her good? O, let her brother live! <|nl|> Thieves for their robbery have authority <|nl|> When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her, <|nl|> That I desire to hear her speak again, <|nl|> And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on? <|nl|> O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint, <|nl|> With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous <|nl|> Is that temptation that doth goad us on <|nl|> To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet, <|nl|> With all her double vigour, art and nature, <|nl|> Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid <|nl|> Subdues me quite. Even till now, <|nl|> When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Hail to you, provost! so I think you are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> I am the provost. What's your will, good friar? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Bound by my charity and my blest order, <|nl|> I come to visit the afflicted spirits <|nl|> Here in the prison. Do me the common right <|nl|> To let me see them and to make me know <|nl|> The nature of their crimes, that I may minister <|nl|> To them accordingly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> I would do more than that, if more were needful. <|nl|> Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine, <|nl|> Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth, <|nl|> Hath blister'd her report: she is with child; <|nl|> And he that got it, sentenced; a young man <|nl|> More fit to do another such offence <|nl|> Than die for this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> When must he die? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> As I do think, to-morrow. <|nl|> I have provided for you: stay awhile, <|nl|> And you shall be conducted. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I do; and bear the shame most patiently. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience, <|nl|> And try your penitence, if it be sound, <|nl|> Or hollowly put on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I'll gladly learn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Love you the man that wrong'd you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> So then it seems your most offenceful act <|nl|> Was mutually committed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Mutually. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Then was your sin of heavier kind than his. <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I do confess it, and repent it, father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> 'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent, <|nl|> As that the sin hath brought you to this shame, <|nl|> Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven, <|nl|> Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it, <|nl|> But as we stand in fear,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> I do repent me, as it is an evil, <|nl|> And take the shame with joy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> There rest. <|nl|> Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow, <|nl|> And I am going with instruction to him. <|nl|> Grace go with you, Benedicite! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JULIET: <|nl|> Must die to-morrow! O injurious love, <|nl|> That respites me a life, whose very comfort <|nl|> Is still a dying horror! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> 'Tis pity of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> When I would pray and think, I think and pray <|nl|> To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words; <|nl|> Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue, <|nl|> Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth, <|nl|> As if I did but only chew his name; <|nl|> And in my heart the strong and swelling evil <|nl|> Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied <|nl|> Is like a good thing, being often read, <|nl|> Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity, <|nl|> Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride, <|nl|> Could I with boot change for an idle plume, <|nl|> Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form, <|nl|> How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit, <|nl|> Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls <|nl|> To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood: <|nl|> Let's write good angel on the devil's horn: <|nl|> 'Tis not the devil's crest. <|nl|> How now! who's there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Teach her the way. <|nl|> O heavens! <|nl|> Why does my blood thus muster to my heart, <|nl|> Making both it unable for itself, <|nl|> And dispossessing all my other parts <|nl|> Of necessary fitness? <|nl|> So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons; <|nl|> Come all to help him, and so stop the air <|nl|> By which he should revive: and even so <|nl|> The general, subject to a well-wish'd king, <|nl|> Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness <|nl|> Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love <|nl|> Must needs appear offence. <|nl|> How now, fair maid? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I am come to know your pleasure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> That you might know it, would much better please me <|nl|> Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Even so. Heaven keep your honour! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be, <|nl|> As long as you or I yet he must die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Under your sentence? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Yea. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve, <|nl|> Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted <|nl|> That his soul sicken not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good <|nl|> To pardon him that hath from nature stolen <|nl|> A man already made, as to remit <|nl|> Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image <|nl|> In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy <|nl|> Falsely to take away a life true made <|nl|> As to put metal in restrained means <|nl|> To make a false one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly. <|nl|> Which had you rather, that the most just law <|nl|> Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him, <|nl|> Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness <|nl|> As she that he hath stain'd? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Sir, believe this, <|nl|> I had rather give my body than my soul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins <|nl|> Stand more for number than for accompt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> How say you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak <|nl|> Against the thing I say. Answer to this: <|nl|> I, now the voice of the recorded law, <|nl|> Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life: <|nl|> Might there not be a charity in sin <|nl|> To save this brother's life? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Please you to do't, <|nl|> I'll take it as a peril to my soul, <|nl|> It is no sin at all, but charity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul, <|nl|> Were equal poise of sin and charity. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> That I do beg his life, if it be sin, <|nl|> Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit, <|nl|> If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer <|nl|> To have it added to the faults of mine, <|nl|> And nothing of your answer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Nay, but hear me. <|nl|> Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant, <|nl|> Or seem so craftily; and that's not good. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good, <|nl|> But graciously to know I am no better. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright <|nl|> When it doth tax itself; as these black masks <|nl|> Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder <|nl|> Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me; <|nl|> To be received plain, I'll speak more gross: <|nl|> Your brother is to die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> So. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> And his offence is so, as it appears, <|nl|> Accountant to the law upon that pain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> True. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Admit no other way to save his life,-- <|nl|> As I subscribe not that, nor any other, <|nl|> But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister, <|nl|> Finding yourself desired of such a person, <|nl|> Whose credit with the judge, or own great place, <|nl|> Could fetch your brother from the manacles <|nl|> Of the all-building law; and that there were <|nl|> No earthly mean to save him, but that either <|nl|> You must lay down the treasures of your body <|nl|> To this supposed, or else to let him suffer; <|nl|> What would you do? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> As much for my poor brother as myself: <|nl|> That is, were I under the terms of death, <|nl|> The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies, <|nl|> And strip myself to death, as to a bed <|nl|> That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield <|nl|> My body up to shame. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Then must your brother die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> And 'twere the cheaper way: <|nl|> Better it were a brother died at once, <|nl|> Than that a sister, by redeeming him, <|nl|> Should die for ever. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Were not you then as cruel as the sentence <|nl|> That you have slander'd so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Ignomy in ransom and free pardon <|nl|> Are of two houses: lawful mercy <|nl|> Is nothing kin to foul redemption. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant; <|nl|> And rather proved the sliding of your brother <|nl|> A merriment than a vice. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out, <|nl|> To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean: <|nl|> I something do excuse the thing I hate, <|nl|> For his advantage that I dearly love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> We are all frail. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Else let my brother die, <|nl|> If not a feodary, but only he <|nl|> Owe and succeed thy weakness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Nay, women are frail too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves; <|nl|> Which are as easy broke as they make forms. <|nl|> Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar <|nl|> In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail; <|nl|> For we are soft as our complexions are, <|nl|> And credulous to false prints. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> I think it well: <|nl|> And from this testimony of your own sex,-- <|nl|> Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger <|nl|> Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold; <|nl|> I do arrest your words. Be that you are, <|nl|> That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none; <|nl|> If you be one, as you are well express'd <|nl|> By all external warrants, show it now, <|nl|> By putting on the destined livery. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord, <|nl|> Let me entreat you speak the former language. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Plainly conceive, I love you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> My brother did love Juliet, <|nl|> And you tell me that he shall die for it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I know your virtue hath a licence in't, <|nl|> Which seems a little fouler than it is, <|nl|> To pluck on others. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Believe me, on mine honour, <|nl|> My words express my purpose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Ha! little honour to be much believed, <|nl|> And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming! <|nl|> I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't: <|nl|> Sign me a present pardon for my brother, <|nl|> Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud <|nl|> What man thou art. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Who will believe thee, Isabel? <|nl|> My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life, <|nl|> My vouch against you, and my place i' the state, <|nl|> Will so your accusation overweigh, <|nl|> That you shall stifle in your own report <|nl|> And smell of calumny. I have begun, <|nl|> And now I give my sensual race the rein: <|nl|> Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite; <|nl|> Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes, <|nl|> That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother <|nl|> By yielding up thy body to my will; <|nl|> Or else he must not only die the death, <|nl|> But thy unkindness shall his death draw out <|nl|> To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow, <|nl|> Or, by the affection that now guides me most, <|nl|> I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you, <|nl|> Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> To whom should I complain? Did I tell this, <|nl|> Who would believe me? O perilous mouths, <|nl|> That bear in them one and the self-same tongue, <|nl|> Either of condemnation or approof; <|nl|> Bidding the law make court'sy to their will: <|nl|> Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite, <|nl|> To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother: <|nl|> Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood, <|nl|> Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour. <|nl|> That, had he twenty heads to tender down <|nl|> On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up, <|nl|> Before his sister should her body stoop <|nl|> To such abhorr'd pollution. <|nl|> Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die: <|nl|> More than our brother is our chastity. <|nl|> I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request, <|nl|> And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> The miserable have no other medicine <|nl|> But only hope: <|nl|> I've hope to live, and am prepared to die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Be absolute for death; either death or life <|nl|> Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life: <|nl|> If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing <|nl|> That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art, <|nl|> Servile to all the skyey influences, <|nl|> That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st, <|nl|> Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool; <|nl|> For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun <|nl|> And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble; <|nl|> For all the accommodations that thou bear'st <|nl|> Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant; <|nl|> For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork <|nl|> Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep, <|nl|> And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st <|nl|> Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself; <|nl|> For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains <|nl|> That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not; <|nl|> For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get, <|nl|> And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain; <|nl|> For thy complexion shifts to strange effects, <|nl|> After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor; <|nl|> For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows, <|nl|> Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey, <|nl|> And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none; <|nl|> For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire, <|nl|> The mere effusion of thy proper loins, <|nl|> Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum, <|nl|> For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age, <|nl|> But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep, <|nl|> Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth <|nl|> Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms <|nl|> Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich, <|nl|> Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty, <|nl|> To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this <|nl|> That bears the name of life? Yet in this life <|nl|> Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear, <|nl|> That makes these odds all even. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> I humbly thank you. <|nl|> To sue to live, I find I seek to die; <|nl|> And, seeking death, find life: let it come on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Most holy sir, I thank you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> My business is a word or two with Claudio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Provost, a word with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> As many as you please. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Now, sister, what's the comfort? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Why, <|nl|> As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed. <|nl|> Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven, <|nl|> Intends you for his swift ambassador, <|nl|> Where you shall be an everlasting leiger: <|nl|> Therefore your best appointment make with speed; <|nl|> To-morrow you set on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Is there no remedy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> None, but such remedy as, to save a head, <|nl|> To cleave a heart in twain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> But is there any? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Yes, brother, you may live: <|nl|> There is a devilish mercy in the judge, <|nl|> If you'll implore it, that will free your life, <|nl|> But fetter you till death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Perpetual durance? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint, <|nl|> Though all the world's vastidity you had, <|nl|> To a determined scope. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> But in what nature? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> In such a one as, you consenting to't, <|nl|> Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, <|nl|> And leave you naked. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Let me know the point. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake, <|nl|> Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain, <|nl|> And six or seven winters more respect <|nl|> Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die? <|nl|> The sense of death is most in apprehension; <|nl|> And the poor beetle, that we tread upon, <|nl|> In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great <|nl|> As when a giant dies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Why give you me this shame? <|nl|> Think you I can a resolution fetch <|nl|> From flowery tenderness? If I must die, <|nl|> I will encounter darkness as a bride, <|nl|> And hug it in mine arms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> There spake my brother; there my father's grave <|nl|> Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die: <|nl|> Thou art too noble to conserve a life <|nl|> In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy, <|nl|> Whose settled visage and deliberate word <|nl|> Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew <|nl|> As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil <|nl|> His filth within being cast, he would appear <|nl|> A pond as deep as hell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> The prenzie Angelo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell, <|nl|> The damned'st body to invest and cover <|nl|> In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio? <|nl|> If I would yield him my virginity, <|nl|> Thou mightst be freed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> O heavens! it cannot be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence, <|nl|> So to offend him still. This night's the time <|nl|> That I should do what I abhor to name, <|nl|> Or else thou diest to-morrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Thou shalt not do't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, were it but my life, <|nl|> I'ld throw it down for your deliverance <|nl|> As frankly as a pin. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Thanks, dear Isabel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Yes. Has he affections in him, <|nl|> That thus can make him bite the law by the nose, <|nl|> When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin, <|nl|> Or of the deadly seven, it is the least. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Which is the least? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> If it were damnable, he being so wise, <|nl|> Why would he for the momentary trick <|nl|> Be perdurably fined? O Isabel! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> What says my brother? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Death is a fearful thing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> And shamed life a hateful. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Ay, but to die, and go we know not where; <|nl|> To lie in cold obstruction and to rot; <|nl|> This sensible warm motion to become <|nl|> A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit <|nl|> To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside <|nl|> In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice; <|nl|> To be imprison'd in the viewless winds, <|nl|> And blown with restless violence round about <|nl|> The pendent world; or to be worse than worst <|nl|> Of those that lawless and incertain thought <|nl|> Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible! <|nl|> The weariest and most loathed worldly life <|nl|> That age, ache, penury and imprisonment <|nl|> Can lay on nature is a paradise <|nl|> To what we fear of death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Alas, alas! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Sweet sister, let me live: <|nl|> What sin you do to save a brother's life, <|nl|> Nature dispenses with the deed so far <|nl|> That it becomes a virtue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O you beast! <|nl|> O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch! <|nl|> Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice? <|nl|> Is't not a kind of incest, to take life <|nl|> From thine own sister's shame? What should I think? <|nl|> Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair! <|nl|> For such a warped slip of wilderness <|nl|> Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance! <|nl|> Die, perish! Might but my bending down <|nl|> Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed: <|nl|> I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death, <|nl|> No word to save thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Nay, hear me, Isabel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, fie, fie, fie! <|nl|> Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade. <|nl|> Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd: <|nl|> 'Tis best thou diest quickly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> O hear me, Isabella! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> What is your will? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and <|nl|> by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I <|nl|> would require is likewise your own benefit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be <|nl|> stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you <|nl|> and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to <|nl|> corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her <|nl|> virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition <|nl|> of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her, <|nl|> hath made him that gracious denial which he is most <|nl|> glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I <|nl|> know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to <|nl|> death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes <|nl|> that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to <|nl|> your knees and make ready. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love <|nl|> with life that I will sue to be rid of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Hold you there: farewell. <|nl|> Provost, a word with you! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> What's your will, father <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me <|nl|> awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my <|nl|> habit no loss shall touch her by my company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> In good time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good: <|nl|> the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty <|nl|> brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of <|nl|> your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever <|nl|> fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, <|nl|> fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but <|nl|> that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should <|nl|> wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this <|nl|> substitute, and to save your brother? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my <|nl|> brother die by the law than my son should be <|nl|> unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke <|nl|> deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can <|nl|> speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or <|nl|> discover his government. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter <|nl|> now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made <|nl|> trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my <|nl|> advisings: to the love I have in doing good a <|nl|> remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe <|nl|> that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged <|nl|> lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from <|nl|> the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious <|nl|> person; and much please the absent duke, if <|nl|> peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of <|nl|> this business. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do <|nl|> anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have <|nl|> you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of <|nl|> Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> She should this Angelo have married; was affianced <|nl|> to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between <|nl|> which time of the contract and limit of the <|nl|> solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea, <|nl|> having in that perished vessel the dowry of his <|nl|> sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the <|nl|> poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and <|nl|> renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most <|nl|> kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of <|nl|> her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her <|nl|> combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them <|nl|> with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole, <|nl|> pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few, <|nl|> bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet <|nl|> wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, <|nl|> is washed with them, but relents not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid <|nl|> from the world! What corruption in this life, that <|nl|> it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the <|nl|> cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps <|nl|> you from dishonour in doing it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Show me how, good father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance <|nl|> of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that <|nl|> in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, <|nl|> like an impediment in the current, made it more <|nl|> violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his <|nl|> requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with <|nl|> his demands to the point; only refer yourself to <|nl|> this advantage, first, that your stay with him may <|nl|> not be long; that the time may have all shadow and <|nl|> silence in it; and the place answer to convenience. <|nl|> This being granted in course,--and now follows <|nl|> all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up <|nl|> your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter <|nl|> acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to <|nl|> her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother <|nl|> saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana <|nl|> advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid <|nl|> will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you <|nl|> think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness <|nl|> of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. <|nl|> What think you of it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> The image of it gives me content already; and I <|nl|> trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily <|nl|> to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his <|nl|> bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will <|nl|> presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated <|nl|> grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that <|nl|> place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that <|nl|> it may be quickly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will <|nl|> needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we <|nl|> shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> O heavens! what stuff is here <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> 'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the <|nl|> merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by <|nl|> order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and <|nl|> furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that <|nl|> craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> And you, good brother father. What offence hath <|nl|> this man made you, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we <|nl|> take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found <|nl|> upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have <|nl|> sent to the deputy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd! <|nl|> The evil that thou causest to be done, <|nl|> That is thy means to live. Do thou but think <|nl|> What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back <|nl|> From such a filthy vice: say to thyself, <|nl|> From their abominable and beastly touches <|nl|> I drink, I eat, array myself, and live. <|nl|> Canst thou believe thy living is a life, <|nl|> So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, <|nl|> sir, I would prove-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin, <|nl|> Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer: <|nl|> Correction and instruction must both work <|nl|> Ere this rude beast will profit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him <|nl|> warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if <|nl|> he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were <|nl|> as good go a mile on his errand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> That we were all, as some would seem to be, <|nl|> From our faults, as faults from seeming, free! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a <|nl|> friend of mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of <|nl|> Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there <|nl|> none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be <|nl|> had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and <|nl|> extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What <|nl|> sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't <|nl|> not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest <|nl|> thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is <|nl|> the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The <|nl|> trick of it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Still thus, and thus; still worse! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she <|nl|> still, ha? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she <|nl|> is herself in the tub. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be <|nl|> so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd: <|nl|> an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going <|nl|> to prison, Pompey? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Yes, faith, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I <|nl|> sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> For being a bawd, for being a bawd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the <|nl|> due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he <|nl|> doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born. <|nl|> Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison, <|nl|> Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you <|nl|> will keep the house. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. <|nl|> I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If <|nl|> you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the <|nl|> more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> And you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Come your ways, sir; come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> You will not bail me, then, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar? <|nl|> what news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ELBOW: <|nl|> Come your ways, sir; come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Go to kennel, Pompey; go. <|nl|> What news, friar, of the duke? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I know none. Can you tell me of any? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other <|nl|> some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from <|nl|> the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born <|nl|> to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he <|nl|> puts transgression to 't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> He does well in 't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in <|nl|> him: something too crabbed that way, friar. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; <|nl|> it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp <|nl|> it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put <|nl|> down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and <|nl|> woman after this downright way of creation: is it <|nl|> true, think you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> How should he be made, then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he <|nl|> was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is <|nl|> certain that when he makes water his urine is <|nl|> congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a <|nl|> motion generative; that's infallible. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the <|nl|> rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a <|nl|> man! Would the duke that is absent have done this? <|nl|> Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a <|nl|> hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing <|nl|> a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he <|nl|> knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I never heard the absent duke much detected for <|nl|> women; he was not inclined that way. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> O, sir, you are deceived. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> 'Tis not possible. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and <|nl|> his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the <|nl|> duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too; <|nl|> that let me inform you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You do him wrong, surely. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the <|nl|> duke: and I believe I know the cause of his <|nl|> withdrawing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> What, I prithee, might be the cause? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the <|nl|> teeth and the lips: but this I can let you <|nl|> understand, the greater file of the subject held the <|nl|> duke to be wise. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Wise! why, no question but he was. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking: <|nl|> the very stream of his life and the business he hath <|nl|> helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better <|nl|> proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own <|nl|> bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the <|nl|> envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier. <|nl|> Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your <|nl|> knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Sir, I know him, and I love him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with <|nl|> dearer love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Come, sir, I know what I know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I can hardly believe that, since you know not what <|nl|> you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our <|nl|> prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your <|nl|> answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, <|nl|> you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call <|nl|> upon you; and, I pray you, your name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to <|nl|> report you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I fear you not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you <|nl|> imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I <|nl|> can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me, <|nl|> friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if <|nl|> Claudio die to-morrow or no? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Why should he die, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would <|nl|> the duke we talk of were returned again: the <|nl|> ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with <|nl|> continency; sparrows must not build in his <|nl|> house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke <|nl|> yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would <|nl|> never bring them to light: would he were returned! <|nl|> Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing. <|nl|> Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The <|nl|> duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on <|nl|> Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee, <|nl|> he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown <|nl|> bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> No might nor greatness in mortality <|nl|> Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny <|nl|> The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong <|nl|> Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue? <|nl|> But who comes here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Go; away with her to prison! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted <|nl|> a merciful man; good my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in <|nl|> the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play <|nl|> the tyrant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please <|nl|> your honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MISTRESS OVERDONE: <|nl|> My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me. <|nl|> Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the <|nl|> duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child <|nl|> is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob: <|nl|> I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be <|nl|> called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to; <|nl|> no more words. <|nl|> Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered; <|nl|> Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished <|nl|> with divines, and have all charitable preparation. <|nl|> if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be <|nl|> so with him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> So please you, this friar hath been with him, and <|nl|> advised him for the entertainment of death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Good even, good father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Bliss and goodness on you! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Of whence are you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Not of this country, though my chance is now <|nl|> To use it for my time: I am a brother <|nl|> Of gracious order, late come from the See <|nl|> In special business from his holiness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> What news abroad i' the world? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> None, but that there is so great a fever on <|nl|> goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it: <|nl|> novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous <|nl|> to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous <|nl|> to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce <|nl|> truth enough alive to make societies secure; but <|nl|> security enough to make fellowships accurst: much <|nl|> upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This <|nl|> news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I <|nl|> pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> One that, above all other strifes, contended <|nl|> especially to know himself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> What pleasure was he given to? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at <|nl|> any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a <|nl|> gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to <|nl|> his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous; <|nl|> and let me desire to know how you find Claudio <|nl|> prepared. I am made to understand that you have <|nl|> lent him visitation. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> He professes to have received no sinister measure <|nl|> from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself <|nl|> to the determination of justice: yet had he framed <|nl|> to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many <|nl|> deceiving promises of life; which I by my good <|nl|> leisure have discredited to him, and now is he <|nl|> resolved to die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> You have paid the heavens your function, and the <|nl|> prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have <|nl|> laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest <|nl|> shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I <|nl|> found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him <|nl|> he is indeed Justice. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> If his own life answer the straitness of his <|nl|> proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he <|nl|> chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Peace be with you! <|nl|> He who the sword of heaven will bear <|nl|> Should be as holy as severe; <|nl|> Pattern in himself to know, <|nl|> Grace to stand, and virtue go; <|nl|> More nor less to others paying <|nl|> Than by self-offences weighing. <|nl|> Shame to him whose cruel striking <|nl|> Kills for faults of his own liking! <|nl|> Twice treble shame on Angelo, <|nl|> To weed my vice and let his grow! <|nl|> O, what may man within him hide, <|nl|> Though angel on the outward side! <|nl|> How may likeness made in crimes, <|nl|> Making practise on the times, <|nl|> To draw with idle spiders' strings <|nl|> Most ponderous and substantial things! <|nl|> Craft against vice I must apply: <|nl|> With Angelo to-night shall lie <|nl|> His old betrothed but despised; <|nl|> So disguise shall, by the disguised, <|nl|> Pay with falsehood false exacting, <|nl|> And perform an old contracting. <|nl|>  <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away: <|nl|> Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice <|nl|> Hath often still'd my brawling discontent. <|nl|> I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish <|nl|> You had not found me here so musical: <|nl|> Let me excuse me, and believe me so, <|nl|> My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> 'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm <|nl|> To make bad good, and good provoke to harm. <|nl|> I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired <|nl|> for me here to-day? much upon this time have <|nl|> I promised here to meet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> You have not been inquired after: <|nl|> I have sat here all day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I do constantly believe you. The time is come even <|nl|> now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may <|nl|> be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> I am always bound to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Very well met, and well come. <|nl|> What is the news from this good deputy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> He hath a garden circummured with brick, <|nl|> Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd; <|nl|> And to that vineyard is a planched gate, <|nl|> That makes his opening with this bigger key: <|nl|> This other doth command a little door <|nl|> Which from the vineyard to the garden leads; <|nl|> There have I made my promise <|nl|> Upon the heavy middle of the night <|nl|> To call upon him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> But shall you on your knowledge find this way? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't: <|nl|> With whispering and most guilty diligence, <|nl|> In action all of precept, he did show me <|nl|> The way twice o'er. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Are there no other tokens <|nl|> Between you 'greed concerning her observance? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> No, none, but only a repair i' the dark; <|nl|> And that I have possess'd him my most stay <|nl|> Can be but brief; for I have made him know <|nl|> I have a servant comes with me along, <|nl|> That stays upon me, whose persuasion is <|nl|> I come about my brother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> 'Tis well borne up. <|nl|> I have not yet made known to Mariana <|nl|> A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth! <|nl|> I pray you, be acquainted with this maid; <|nl|> She comes to do you good. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I do desire the like. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Do you persuade yourself that I respect you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Good friar, I know you do, and have found it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Take, then, this your companion by the hand, <|nl|> Who hath a story ready for your ear. <|nl|> I shall attend your leisure: but make haste; <|nl|> The vaporous night approaches. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Will't please you walk aside? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> O place and greatness! millions of false eyes <|nl|> Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report <|nl|> Run with these false and most contrarious quests <|nl|> Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit <|nl|> Make thee the father of their idle dreams <|nl|> And rack thee in their fancies. <|nl|> Welcome, how agreed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> She'll take the enterprise upon her, father, <|nl|> If you advise it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> It is not my consent, <|nl|> But my entreaty too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Little have you to say <|nl|> When you depart from him, but, soft and low, <|nl|> 'Remember now my brother.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Fear me not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all. <|nl|> He is your husband on a pre-contract: <|nl|> To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin, <|nl|> Sith that the justice of your title to him <|nl|> Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go: <|nl|> Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a <|nl|> married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never <|nl|> cut off a woman's head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a <|nl|> direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio <|nl|> and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common <|nl|> executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if <|nl|> you will take it on you to assist him, it shall <|nl|> redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have <|nl|> your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance <|nl|> with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a <|nl|> notorious bawd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind; <|nl|> but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I <|nl|> would be glad to receive some instruction from my <|nl|> fellow partner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Do you call, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in <|nl|> your execution. If you think it meet, compound with <|nl|> him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if <|nl|> not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He <|nl|> cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn <|nl|> the scale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a <|nl|> good favour you have, but that you have a hanging <|nl|> look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Ay, sir; a mystery <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and <|nl|> your whores, sir, being members of my occupation, <|nl|> using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery: <|nl|> but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I <|nl|> should be hanged, I cannot imagine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Sir, it is a mystery. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Proof? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be <|nl|> too little for your thief, your true man thinks it <|nl|> big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your <|nl|> thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's <|nl|> apparel fits your thief. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Are you agreed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is <|nl|> a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth <|nl|> oftener ask forgiveness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe <|nl|> to-morrow four o'clock. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have <|nl|> occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find <|nl|> me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you <|nl|> a good turn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Call hither Barnardine and Claudio: <|nl|> The one has my pity; not a jot the other, <|nl|> Being a murderer, though he were my brother. <|nl|> Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death: <|nl|> 'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow <|nl|> Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CLAUDIO: <|nl|> As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour <|nl|> When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones: <|nl|> He will not wake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Who can do good on him? <|nl|> Well, go, prepare yourself. <|nl|> But, hark, what noise? <|nl|> Heaven give your spirits comfort! <|nl|> By and by. <|nl|> I hope it is some pardon or reprieve <|nl|> For the most gentle Claudio. <|nl|> Welcome father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> The best and wholesomest spirts of the night <|nl|> Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> None, since the curfew rung. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Not Isabel? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> No. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> They will, then, ere't be long. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> What comfort is for Claudio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> There's some in hope. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> It is a bitter deputy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd <|nl|> Even with the stroke and line of his great justice: <|nl|> He doth with holy abstinence subdue <|nl|> That in himself which he spurs on his power <|nl|> To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that <|nl|> Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous; <|nl|> But this being so, he's just. <|nl|> Now are they come. <|nl|> This is a gentle provost: seldom when <|nl|> The steeled gaoler is the friend of men. <|nl|> How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste <|nl|> That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> There he must stay until the officer <|nl|> Arise to let him in: he is call'd up. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Have you no countermand for Claudio yet, <|nl|> But he must die to-morrow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> None, sir, none. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> As near the dawning, provost, as it is, <|nl|> You shall hear more ere morning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Happily <|nl|> You something know; yet I believe there comes <|nl|> No countermand; no such example have we: <|nl|> Besides, upon the very siege of justice <|nl|> Lord Angelo hath to the public ear <|nl|> Profess'd the contrary. <|nl|> This is his lordship's man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> And here comes Claudio's pardon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> I shall obey him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss <|nl|> in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted <|nl|> putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Pray you, let's hear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the <|nl|> afternoon? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one <|nl|> that is a prisoner nine years old. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> How came it that the absent duke had not either <|nl|> delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I <|nl|> have heard it was ever his manner to do so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and, <|nl|> indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord <|nl|> Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> It is now apparent? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Most manifest, and not denied by himself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how <|nl|> seems he to be touched? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but <|nl|> as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless <|nl|> of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of <|nl|> mortality, and desperately mortal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> He wants advice. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty <|nl|> of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he <|nl|> would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days <|nl|> entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if <|nl|> to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming <|nl|> warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> More of him anon. There is written in your brow, <|nl|> provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not <|nl|> truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the <|nl|> boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard. <|nl|> Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is <|nl|> no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath <|nl|> sentenced him. To make you understand this in a <|nl|> manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite; <|nl|> for the which you are to do me both a present and a <|nl|> dangerous courtesy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Pray, sir, in what? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> In the delaying death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited, <|nl|> and an express command, under penalty, to deliver <|nl|> his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case <|nl|> as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my <|nl|> instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine <|nl|> be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. <|nl|> Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was <|nl|> the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his <|nl|> death: you know the course is common. If any thing <|nl|> fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good <|nl|> fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead <|nl|> against it with my life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> To him, and to his substitutes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You will think you have made no offence, if the duke <|nl|> avouch the justice of your dealing? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> But what likelihood is in that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see <|nl|> you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor <|nl|> persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go <|nl|> further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. <|nl|> Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the <|nl|> duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the <|nl|> signet is not strange to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> I know them both. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> The contents of this is the return of the duke: you <|nl|> shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you <|nl|> shall find, within these two days he will be here. <|nl|> This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this <|nl|> very day receives letters of strange tenor; <|nl|> perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering <|nl|> into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what <|nl|> is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the <|nl|> shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these <|nl|> things should be: all difficulties are but easy <|nl|> when they are known. Call your executioner, and off <|nl|> with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present <|nl|> shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you <|nl|> are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you. <|nl|> Come away; it is almost clear dawn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house <|nl|> of profession: one would think it were Mistress <|nl|> Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old <|nl|> customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in <|nl|> for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger, <|nl|> ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made <|nl|> five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not <|nl|> much in request, for the old women were all dead. <|nl|> Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of <|nl|> Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of <|nl|> peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a <|nl|> beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young <|nl|> Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master <|nl|> Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young <|nl|> Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master <|nl|> Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the <|nl|> great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed <|nl|> Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in <|nl|> our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged. <|nl|> Master Barnardine! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> What, ho, Barnardine! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BARNARDINE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so <|nl|> good, sir, to rise and be put to death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BARNARDINE: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are <|nl|> executed, and sleep afterwards. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Go in to him, and fetch him out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Is the axe upon the block, sirrah? <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> Very ready, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BARNARDINE: <|nl|> How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your <|nl|> prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BARNARDINE: <|nl|> You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not <|nl|> fitted for 't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> POMPEY: <|nl|> O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night, <|nl|> and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the <|nl|> sounder all the next day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ABHORSON: <|nl|> Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do <|nl|> we jest now, think you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily <|nl|> you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort <|nl|> you and pray with you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BARNARDINE: <|nl|> Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night, <|nl|> and I will have more time to prepare me, or they <|nl|> shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not <|nl|> consent to die this day, that's certain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you <|nl|> Look forward on the journey you shall go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BARNARDINE: <|nl|> I swear I will not die to-day for any man's <|nl|> persuasion. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> But hear you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BARNARDINE: <|nl|> Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me, <|nl|> come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart! <|nl|> After him, fellows; bring him to the block. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> A creature unprepared, unmeet for death; <|nl|> And to transport him in the mind he is <|nl|> Were damnable. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Here in the prison, father, <|nl|> There died this morning of a cruel fever <|nl|> One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate, <|nl|> A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head <|nl|> Just of his colour. What if we do omit <|nl|> This reprobate till he were well inclined; <|nl|> And satisfy the deputy with the visage <|nl|> Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides! <|nl|> Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on <|nl|> Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done, <|nl|> And sent according to command; whiles I <|nl|> Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> This shall be done, good father, presently. <|nl|> But Barnardine must die this afternoon: <|nl|> And how shall we continue Claudio, <|nl|> To save me from the danger that might come <|nl|> If he were known alive? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Let this be done. <|nl|> Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio: <|nl|> Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting <|nl|> To the under generation, you shall find <|nl|> Your safety manifested. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> I am your free dependant. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo. <|nl|> Now will I write letters to Angelo,-- <|nl|> The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents <|nl|> Shall witness to him I am near at home, <|nl|> And that, by great injunctions, I am bound <|nl|> To enter publicly: him I'll desire <|nl|> To meet me at the consecrated fount <|nl|> A league below the city; and from thence, <|nl|> By cold gradation and well-balanced form, <|nl|> We shall proceed with Angelo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Here is the head; I'll carry it myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Convenient is it. Make a swift return; <|nl|> For I would commune with you of such things <|nl|> That want no ear but yours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> I'll make all speed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know <|nl|> If yet her brother's pardon be come hither: <|nl|> But I will keep her ignorant of her good, <|nl|> To make her heavenly comforts of despair, <|nl|> When it is least expected. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Ho, by your leave! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> The better, given me by so holy a man. <|nl|> Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> He hath released him, Isabel, from the world: <|nl|> His head is off and sent to Angelo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Nay, but it is not so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter, <|nl|> In your close patience. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You shall not be admitted to his sight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel! <|nl|> Injurious world! most damned Angelo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot; <|nl|> Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven. <|nl|> Mark what I say, which you shall find <|nl|> By every syllable a faithful verity: <|nl|> The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes; <|nl|> One of our convent, and his confessor, <|nl|> Gives me this instance: already he hath carried <|nl|> Notice to Escalus and Angelo, <|nl|> Who do prepare to meet him at the gates, <|nl|> There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom <|nl|> In that good path that I would wish it go, <|nl|> And you shall have your bosom on this wretch, <|nl|> Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart, <|nl|> And general honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I am directed by you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> This letter, then, to Friar Peter give; <|nl|> 'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return: <|nl|> Say, by this token, I desire his company <|nl|> At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours <|nl|> I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you <|nl|> Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo <|nl|> Accuse him home and home. For my poor self, <|nl|> I am combined by a sacred vow <|nl|> And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter: <|nl|> Command these fretting waters from your eyes <|nl|> With a light heart; trust not my holy order, <|nl|> If I pervert your course. Who's here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Good even. Friar, where's the provost? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Not within, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see <|nl|> thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain <|nl|> to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for <|nl|> my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set <|nl|> me to 't. But they say the duke will be here <|nl|> to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother: <|nl|> if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been <|nl|> at home, he had lived. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your <|nl|> reports; but the best is, he lives not in them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do: <|nl|> he's a better woodman than thou takest him for. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee <|nl|> I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You have told me too many of him already, sir, if <|nl|> they be true; if not true, none were enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I was once before him for getting a wench with child. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Did you such a thing? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it; <|nl|> they would else have married me to the rotten medlar. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end: <|nl|> if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of <|nl|> it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions <|nl|> show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be <|nl|> not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and <|nl|> redeliver our authorities there <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I guess not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his <|nl|> entering, that if any crave redress of injustice, <|nl|> they should exhibit their petitions in the street? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of <|nl|> complaints, and to deliver us from devices <|nl|> hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand <|nl|> against us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes <|nl|> i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give <|nl|> notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet <|nl|> him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I shall, sir. Fare you well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Good night. <|nl|> This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant <|nl|> And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid! <|nl|> And by an eminent body that enforced <|nl|> The law against it! But that her tender shame <|nl|> Will not proclaim against her maiden loss, <|nl|> How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no; <|nl|> For my authority bears of a credent bulk, <|nl|> That no particular scandal once can touch <|nl|> But it confounds the breather. He should have lived, <|nl|> Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense, <|nl|> Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge, <|nl|> By so receiving a dishonour'd life <|nl|> With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived! <|nl|> A lack, when once our grace we have forgot, <|nl|> Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> These letters at fit time deliver me <|nl|> The provost knows our purpose and our plot. <|nl|> The matter being afoot, keep your instruction, <|nl|> And hold you ever to our special drift; <|nl|> Though sometimes you do blench from this to that, <|nl|> As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house, <|nl|> And tell him where I stay: give the like notice <|nl|> To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus, <|nl|> And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate; <|nl|> But send me Flavius first. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR PETER: <|nl|> It shall be speeded well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste: <|nl|> Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends <|nl|> Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> To speak so indirectly I am loath: <|nl|> I would say the truth; but to accuse him so, <|nl|> That is your part: yet I am advised to do it; <|nl|> He says, to veil full purpose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Be ruled by him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure <|nl|> He speak against me on the adverse side, <|nl|> I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic <|nl|> That's bitter to sweet end. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> I would Friar Peter-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, peace! the friar is come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR PETER: <|nl|> Come, I have found you out a stand most fit, <|nl|> Where you may have such vantage on the duke, <|nl|> He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded; <|nl|> The generous and gravest citizens <|nl|> Have hent the gates, and very near upon <|nl|> The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> My very worthy cousin, fairly met! <|nl|> Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Happy return be to your royal grace! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Many and hearty thankings to you both. <|nl|> We have made inquiry of you; and we hear <|nl|> Such goodness of your justice, that our soul <|nl|> Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks, <|nl|> Forerunning more requital. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> You make my bonds still greater. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it, <|nl|> To lock it in the wards of covert bosom, <|nl|> When it deserves, with characters of brass, <|nl|> A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time <|nl|> And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand, <|nl|> And let the subject see, to make them know <|nl|> That outward courtesies would fain proclaim <|nl|> Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus, <|nl|> You must walk by us on our other hand; <|nl|> And good supporters are you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR PETER: <|nl|> Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard <|nl|> Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid! <|nl|> O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye <|nl|> By throwing it on any other object <|nl|> Till you have heard me in my true complaint <|nl|> And given me justice, justice, justice, justice! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief. <|nl|> Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice: <|nl|> Reveal yourself to him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O worthy duke, <|nl|> You bid me seek redemption of the devil: <|nl|> Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak <|nl|> Must either punish me, not being believed, <|nl|> Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm: <|nl|> She hath been a suitor to me for her brother <|nl|> Cut off by course of justice,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> By course of justice! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> And she will speak most bitterly and strange. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak: <|nl|> That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange? <|nl|> That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange? <|nl|> That Angelo is an adulterous thief, <|nl|> An hypocrite, a virgin-violator; <|nl|> Is it not strange and strange? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Nay, it is ten times strange. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> It is not truer he is Angelo <|nl|> Than this is all as true as it is strange: <|nl|> Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth <|nl|> To the end of reckoning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Away with her! Poor soul, <|nl|> She speaks this in the infirmity of sense. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest <|nl|> There is another comfort than this world, <|nl|> That thou neglect me not, with that opinion <|nl|> That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible <|nl|> That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible <|nl|> But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground, <|nl|> May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute <|nl|> As Angelo; even so may Angelo, <|nl|> In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms, <|nl|> Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince: <|nl|> If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more, <|nl|> Had I more name for badness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> By mine honesty, <|nl|> If she be mad,--as I believe no other,-- <|nl|> Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense, <|nl|> Such a dependency of thing on thing, <|nl|> As e'er I heard in madness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O gracious duke, <|nl|> Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason <|nl|> For inequality; but let your reason serve <|nl|> To make the truth appear where it seems hid, <|nl|> And hide the false seems true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Many that are not mad <|nl|> Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I am the sister of one Claudio, <|nl|> Condemn'd upon the act of fornication <|nl|> To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo: <|nl|> I, in probation of a sisterhood, <|nl|> Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio <|nl|> As then the messenger,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> That's I, an't like your grace: <|nl|> I came to her from Claudio, and desired her <|nl|> To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo <|nl|> For her poor brother's pardon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> That's he indeed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You were not bid to speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> No, my good lord; <|nl|> Nor wish'd to hold my peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I wish you now, then; <|nl|> Pray you, take note of it: and when you have <|nl|> A business for yourself, pray heaven you then <|nl|> Be perfect. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I warrant your honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> The warrants for yourself; take heed to't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Right. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> It may be right; but you are i' the wrong <|nl|> To speak before your time. Proceed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I went <|nl|> To this pernicious caitiff deputy,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> That's somewhat madly spoken. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Pardon it; <|nl|> The phrase is to the matter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Mended again. The matter; proceed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> In brief, to set the needless process by, <|nl|> How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd, <|nl|> How he refell'd me, and how I replied,-- <|nl|> For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion <|nl|> I now begin with grief and shame to utter: <|nl|> He would not, but by gift of my chaste body <|nl|> To his concupiscible intemperate lust, <|nl|> Release my brother; and, after much debatement, <|nl|> My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour, <|nl|> And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes, <|nl|> His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant <|nl|> For my poor brother's head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> This is most likely! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, that it were as like as it is true! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st, <|nl|> Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour <|nl|> In hateful practise. First, his integrity <|nl|> Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason <|nl|> That with such vehemency he should pursue <|nl|> Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended, <|nl|> He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself <|nl|> And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on: <|nl|> Confess the truth, and say by whose advice <|nl|> Thou camest here to complain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> And is this all? <|nl|> Then, O you blessed ministers above, <|nl|> Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time <|nl|> Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up <|nl|> In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe, <|nl|> As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer! <|nl|> To prison with her! Shall we thus permit <|nl|> A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall <|nl|> On him so near us? This needs must be a practise. <|nl|> Who knew of Your intent and coming hither? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar; <|nl|> I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord <|nl|> For certain words he spake against your grace <|nl|> In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Words against me? this is a good friar, belike! <|nl|> And to set on this wretched woman here <|nl|> Against our substitute! Let this friar be found. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar, <|nl|> I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar, <|nl|> A very scurvy fellow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR PETER: <|nl|> Blessed be your royal grace! <|nl|> I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard <|nl|> Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman <|nl|> Most wrongfully accused your substitute, <|nl|> Who is as free from touch or soil with her <|nl|> As she from one ungot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> We did believe no less. <|nl|> Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR PETER: <|nl|> I know him for a man divine and holy; <|nl|> Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler, <|nl|> As he's reported by this gentleman; <|nl|> And, on my trust, a man that never yet <|nl|> Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> My lord, most villanously; believe it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR PETER: <|nl|> Well, he in time may come to clear himself; <|nl|> But at this instant he is sick my lord, <|nl|> Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request, <|nl|> Being come to knowledge that there was complaint <|nl|> Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither, <|nl|> To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know <|nl|> Is true and false; and what he with his oath <|nl|> And all probation will make up full clear, <|nl|> Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman. <|nl|> To justify this worthy nobleman, <|nl|> So vulgarly and personally accused, <|nl|> Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes, <|nl|> Till she herself confess it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Good friar, let's hear it. <|nl|> Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo? <|nl|> O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools! <|nl|> Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo; <|nl|> In this I'll be impartial; be you judge <|nl|> Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar? <|nl|> First, let her show her face, and after speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face <|nl|> Until my husband bid me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> What, are you married? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> No, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Are you a maid? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> No, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> A widow, then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Neither, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are <|nl|> neither maid, widow, nor wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause <|nl|> To prattle for himself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Well, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married; <|nl|> And I confess besides I am no maid: <|nl|> I have known my husband; yet my husband <|nl|> Knows not that ever he knew me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Well, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> This is no witness for Lord Angelo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Now I come to't my lord <|nl|> She that accuses him of fornication, <|nl|> In self-same manner doth accuse my husband, <|nl|> And charges him my lord, with such a time <|nl|> When I'll depose I had him in mine arms <|nl|> With all the effect of love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Charges she more than me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Not that I know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> No? you say your husband. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo, <|nl|> Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body, <|nl|> But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> My husband bids me; now I will unmask. <|nl|> This is that face, thou cruel Angelo, <|nl|> Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on; <|nl|> This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract, <|nl|> Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body <|nl|> That took away the match from Isabel, <|nl|> And did supply thee at thy garden-house <|nl|> In her imagined person. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Know you this woman? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Carnally, she says. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Sirrah, no more! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Enough, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> My lord, I must confess I know this woman: <|nl|> And five years since there was some speech of marriage <|nl|> Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off, <|nl|> Partly for that her promised proportions <|nl|> Came short of composition, but in chief <|nl|> For that her reputation was disvalued <|nl|> In levity: since which time of five years <|nl|> I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her, <|nl|> Upon my faith and honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Noble prince, <|nl|> As there comes light from heaven and words from breath, <|nl|> As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue, <|nl|> I am affianced this man's wife as strongly <|nl|> As words could make up vows: and, my good lord, <|nl|> But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house <|nl|> He knew me as a wife. As this is true, <|nl|> Let me in safety raise me from my knees <|nl|> Or else for ever be confixed here, <|nl|> A marble monument! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> I did but smile till now: <|nl|> Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice <|nl|> My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive <|nl|> These poor informal women are no more <|nl|> But instruments of some more mightier member <|nl|> That sets them on: let me have way, my lord, <|nl|> To find this practise out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Ay, with my heart <|nl|> And punish them to your height of pleasure. <|nl|> Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman, <|nl|> Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths, <|nl|> Though they would swear down each particular saint, <|nl|> Were testimonies against his worth and credit <|nl|> That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus, <|nl|> Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains <|nl|> To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived. <|nl|> There is another friar that set them on; <|nl|> Let him be sent for. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRIAR PETER: <|nl|> Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed <|nl|> Hath set the women on to this complaint: <|nl|> Your provost knows the place where he abides <|nl|> And he may fetch him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Go do it instantly. <|nl|> And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin, <|nl|> Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth, <|nl|> Do with your injuries as seems you best, <|nl|> In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you; <|nl|> But stir not you till you have well determined <|nl|> Upon these slanderers. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> My lord, we'll do it throughly. <|nl|> Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that <|nl|> Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> 'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing <|nl|> but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most <|nl|> villanous speeches of the duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and <|nl|> enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a <|nl|> notable fellow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> As any in Vienna, on my word. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her. <|nl|> Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you <|nl|> shall see how I'll handle her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Not better than he, by her own report. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Say you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, <|nl|> she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly, <|nl|> she'll be ashamed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I will go darkly to work with her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> That's the way; for women are light at midnight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all <|nl|> that you have said. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with <|nl|> the provost. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> In very good time: speak not you to him till we <|nl|> call upon you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Mum. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander <|nl|> Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> 'Tis false. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> How! know you where you are? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Respect to your great place! and let the devil <|nl|> Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne! <|nl|> Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak: <|nl|> Look you speak justly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls, <|nl|> Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox? <|nl|> Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone? <|nl|> Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust, <|nl|> Thus to retort your manifest appeal, <|nl|> And put your trial in the villain's mouth <|nl|> Which here you come to accuse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar, <|nl|> Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women <|nl|> To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth <|nl|> And in the witness of his proper ear, <|nl|> To call him villain? and then to glance from him <|nl|> To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice? <|nl|> Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you <|nl|> Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose. <|nl|> What 'unjust'! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Be not so hot; the duke <|nl|> Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he <|nl|> Dare rack his own: his subject am I not, <|nl|> Nor here provincial. My business in this state <|nl|> Made me a looker on here in Vienna, <|nl|> Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble <|nl|> Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults, <|nl|> But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes <|nl|> Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, <|nl|> As much in mock as mark. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Slander to the state! Away with him to prison! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio? <|nl|> Is this the man that you did tell us of? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> 'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate: <|nl|> do you know me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I <|nl|> met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Most notedly, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a <|nl|> fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make <|nl|> that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and <|nl|> much more, much worse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the <|nl|> nose for thy speeches? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I protest I love the duke as I love myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> Hark, how the villain would close now, after his <|nl|> treasonable abuses! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with <|nl|> him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him <|nl|> to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him <|nl|> speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and <|nl|> with the other confederate companion! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> What, resists he? Help him, Lucio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you <|nl|> bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must <|nl|> you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you! <|nl|> show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour! <|nl|> Will't not off? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke. <|nl|> First, provost, let me bail these gentle three. <|nl|> Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you <|nl|> Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> This may prove worse than hanging. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> O my dread lord, <|nl|> I should be guiltier than my guiltiness, <|nl|> To think I can be undiscernible, <|nl|> When I perceive your grace, like power divine, <|nl|> Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince, <|nl|> No longer session hold upon my shame, <|nl|> But let my trial be mine own confession: <|nl|> Immediate sentence then and sequent death <|nl|> Is all the grace I beg. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Come hither, Mariana. <|nl|> Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> I was, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Go take her hence, and marry her instantly. <|nl|> Do you the office, friar; which consummate, <|nl|> Return him here again. Go with him, provost. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour <|nl|> Than at the strangeness of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Come hither, Isabel. <|nl|> Your friar is now your prince: as I was then <|nl|> Advertising and holy to your business, <|nl|> Not changing heart with habit, I am still <|nl|> Attorney'd at your service. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> O, give me pardon, <|nl|> That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd <|nl|> Your unknown sovereignty! <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You are pardon'd, Isabel: <|nl|> And now, dear maid, be you as free to us. <|nl|> Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart; <|nl|> And you may marvel why I obscured myself, <|nl|> Labouring to save his life, and would not rather <|nl|> Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power <|nl|> Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid, <|nl|> It was the swift celerity of his death, <|nl|> Which I did think with slower foot came on, <|nl|> That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him! <|nl|> That life is better life, past fearing death, <|nl|> Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort, <|nl|> So happy is your brother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> I do, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> For this new-married man approaching here, <|nl|> Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd <|nl|> Your well defended honour, you must pardon <|nl|> For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,-- <|nl|> Being criminal, in double violation <|nl|> Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach <|nl|> Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,-- <|nl|> The very mercy of the law cries out <|nl|> Most audible, even from his proper tongue, <|nl|> 'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!' <|nl|> Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; <|nl|> Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE. <|nl|> Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested; <|nl|> Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage. <|nl|> We do condemn thee to the very block <|nl|> Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste. <|nl|> Away with him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> O my most gracious lord, <|nl|> I hope you will not mock me with a husband. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> It is your husband mock'd you with a husband. <|nl|> Consenting to the safeguard of your honour, <|nl|> I thought your marriage fit; else imputation, <|nl|> For that he knew you, might reproach your life <|nl|> And choke your good to come; for his possessions, <|nl|> Although by confiscation they are ours, <|nl|> We do instate and widow you withal, <|nl|> To buy you a better husband. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> O my dear lord, <|nl|> I crave no other, nor no better man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Never crave him; we are definitive. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Gentle my liege,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You do but lose your labour. <|nl|> Away with him to death! <|nl|> Now, sir, to you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part; <|nl|> Lend me your knees, and all my life to come <|nl|> I'll lend you all my life to do you service. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Against all sense you do importune her: <|nl|> Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact, <|nl|> Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break, <|nl|> And take her hence in horror. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Isabel, <|nl|> Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me; <|nl|> Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all. <|nl|> They say, best men are moulded out of faults; <|nl|> And, for the most, become much more the better <|nl|> For being a little bad: so may my husband. <|nl|> O Isabel, will you not lend a knee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> He dies for Claudio's death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ISABELLA: <|nl|> Most bounteous sir, <|nl|> Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd, <|nl|> As if my brother lived: I partly think <|nl|> A due sincerity govern'd his deeds, <|nl|> Till he did look on me: since it is so, <|nl|> Let him not die. My brother had but justice, <|nl|> In that he did the thing for which he died: <|nl|> For Angelo, <|nl|> His act did not o'ertake his bad intent, <|nl|> And must be buried but as an intent <|nl|> That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects; <|nl|> Intents but merely thoughts. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MARIANA: <|nl|> Merely, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say. <|nl|> I have bethought me of another fault. <|nl|> Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded <|nl|> At an unusual hour? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> It was commanded so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Had you a special warrant for the deed? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> No, my good lord; it was by private message. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> For which I do discharge you of your office: <|nl|> Give up your keys. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> Pardon me, noble lord: <|nl|> I thought it was a fault, but knew it not; <|nl|> Yet did repent me, after more advice; <|nl|> For testimony whereof, one in the prison, <|nl|> That should by private order else have died, <|nl|> I have reserved alive. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> What's he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> His name is Barnardine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I would thou hadst done so by Claudio. <|nl|> Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ESCALUS: <|nl|> I am sorry, one so learned and so wise <|nl|> As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd, <|nl|> Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood. <|nl|> And lack of temper'd judgment afterward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANGELO: <|nl|> I am sorry that such sorrow I procure: <|nl|> And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart <|nl|> That I crave death more willingly than mercy; <|nl|> 'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Which is that Barnardine? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> This, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> There was a friar told me of this man. <|nl|> Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul. <|nl|> That apprehends no further than this world, <|nl|> And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd: <|nl|> But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all; <|nl|> And pray thee take this mercy to provide <|nl|> For better times to come. Friar, advise him; <|nl|> I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Provost: <|nl|> This is another prisoner that I saved. <|nl|> Who should have died when Claudio lost his head; <|nl|> As like almost to Claudio as himself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> 'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the <|nl|> trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I <|nl|> had rather it would please you I might be whipt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Whipt first, sir, and hanged after. <|nl|> Proclaim it, provost, round about the city. <|nl|> Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow, <|nl|> As I have heard him swear himself there's one <|nl|> Whom he begot with child, let her appear, <|nl|> And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd, <|nl|> Let him be whipt and hang'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore. <|nl|> Your highness said even now, I made you a duke: <|nl|> good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her. <|nl|> Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal <|nl|> Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison; <|nl|> And see our pleasure herein executed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCIO: <|nl|> Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, <|nl|> whipping, and hanging. <|nl|>  <|nl|> DUKE VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Slandering a prince deserves it. <|nl|> She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore. <|nl|> Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo: <|nl|> I have confess'd her and I know her virtue. <|nl|> Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness: <|nl|> There's more behind that is more gratulate. <|nl|> Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy: <|nl|> We shill employ thee in a worthier place. <|nl|> Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home <|nl|> The head of Ragozine for Claudio's: <|nl|> The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel, <|nl|> I have a motion much imports your good; <|nl|> Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline, <|nl|> What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine. <|nl|> So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show <|nl|> What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> I'll pheeze you, in faith. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Hostess: <|nl|> A pair of stocks, you rogue! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in <|nl|> the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror. <|nl|> Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Hostess: <|nl|> You will not pay for the glasses you have burst? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold <|nl|> bed, and warm thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Hostess: <|nl|> I know my remedy; I must go fetch the <|nl|> third--borough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him <|nl|> by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come, <|nl|> and kindly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds: <|nl|> Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd; <|nl|> And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach. <|nl|> Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good <|nl|> At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault? <|nl|> I would not lose the dog for twenty pound. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Huntsman: <|nl|> Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord; <|nl|> He cried upon it at the merest loss <|nl|> And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent: <|nl|> Trust me, I take him for the better dog. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet, <|nl|> I would esteem him worth a dozen such. <|nl|> But sup them well and look unto them all: <|nl|> To-morrow I intend to hunt again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Huntsman: <|nl|> I will, my lord. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Huntsman: <|nl|> He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale, <|nl|> This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies! <|nl|> Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image! <|nl|> Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man. <|nl|> What think you, if he were convey'd to bed, <|nl|> Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers, <|nl|> A most delicious banquet by his bed, <|nl|> And brave attendants near him when he wakes, <|nl|> Would not the beggar then forget himself? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Huntsman: <|nl|> Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Huntsman: <|nl|> It would seem strange unto him when he waked. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy. <|nl|> Then take him up and manage well the jest: <|nl|> Carry him gently to my fairest chamber <|nl|> And hang it round with all my wanton pictures: <|nl|> Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters <|nl|> And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet: <|nl|> Procure me music ready when he wakes, <|nl|> To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound; <|nl|> And if he chance to speak, be ready straight <|nl|> And with a low submissive reverence <|nl|> Say 'What is it your honour will command?' <|nl|> Let one attend him with a silver basin <|nl|> Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers, <|nl|> Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper, <|nl|> And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?' <|nl|> Some one be ready with a costly suit <|nl|> And ask him what apparel he will wear; <|nl|> Another tell him of his hounds and horse, <|nl|> And that his lady mourns at his disease: <|nl|> Persuade him that he hath been lunatic; <|nl|> And when he says he is, say that he dreams, <|nl|> For he is nothing but a mighty lord. <|nl|> This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs: <|nl|> It will be pastime passing excellent, <|nl|> If it be husbanded with modesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Huntsman: <|nl|> My lord, I warrant you we will play our part, <|nl|> As he shall think by our true diligence <|nl|> He is no less than what we say he is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Take him up gently and to bed with him; <|nl|> And each one to his office when he wakes. <|nl|> Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds: <|nl|> Belike, some noble gentleman that means, <|nl|> Travelling some journey, to repose him here. <|nl|> How now! who is it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> An't please your honour, players <|nl|> That offer service to your lordship. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Bid them come near. <|nl|> Now, fellows, you are welcome. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Players: <|nl|> We thank your honour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Do you intend to stay with me tonight? <|nl|>  <|nl|> A Player: <|nl|> So please your lordship to accept our duty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> With all my heart. This fellow I remember, <|nl|> Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son: <|nl|> 'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well: <|nl|> I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part <|nl|> Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> A Player: <|nl|> I think 'twas Soto that your honour means. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> 'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent. <|nl|> Well, you are come to me in a happy time; <|nl|> The rather for I have some sport in hand <|nl|> Wherein your cunning can assist me much. <|nl|> There is a lord will hear you play to-night: <|nl|> But I am doubtful of your modesties; <|nl|> Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,-- <|nl|> For yet his honour never heard a play-- <|nl|> You break into some merry passion <|nl|> And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs, <|nl|> If you should smile he grows impatient. <|nl|>  <|nl|> A Player: <|nl|> Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves, <|nl|> Were he the veriest antic in the world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery, <|nl|> And give them friendly welcome every one: <|nl|> Let them want nothing that my house affords. <|nl|> Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page, <|nl|> And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady: <|nl|> That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber; <|nl|> And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance. <|nl|> Tell him from me, as he will win my love, <|nl|> He bear himself with honourable action, <|nl|> Such as he hath observed in noble ladies <|nl|> Unto their lords, by them accomplished: <|nl|> Such duty to the drunkard let him do <|nl|> With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy, <|nl|> And say 'What is't your honour will command, <|nl|> Wherein your lady and your humble wife <|nl|> May show her duty and make known her love?' <|nl|> And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses, <|nl|> And with declining head into his bosom, <|nl|> Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd <|nl|> To see her noble lord restored to health, <|nl|> Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him <|nl|> No better than a poor and loathsome beggar: <|nl|> And if the boy have not a woman's gift <|nl|> To rain a shower of commanded tears, <|nl|> An onion will do well for such a shift, <|nl|> Which in a napkin being close convey'd <|nl|> Shall in despite enforce a watery eye. <|nl|> See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst: <|nl|> Anon I'll give thee more instructions. <|nl|> I know the boy will well usurp the grace, <|nl|> Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman: <|nl|> I long to hear him call the drunkard husband, <|nl|> And how my men will stay themselves from laughter <|nl|> When they do homage to this simple peasant. <|nl|> I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence <|nl|> May well abate the over-merry spleen <|nl|> Which otherwise would grow into extremes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> For God's sake, a pot of small ale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> Will't please your honour taste of these conserves? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servant: <|nl|> What raiment will your honour wear to-day? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor <|nl|> 'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if <|nl|> you give me any conserves, give me conserves of <|nl|> beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I <|nl|> have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings <|nl|> than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay, <|nl|> sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my <|nl|> toes look through the over-leather. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour! <|nl|> O, that a mighty man of such descent, <|nl|> Of such possessions and so high esteem, <|nl|> Should be infused with so foul a spirit! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher <|nl|> Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a <|nl|> pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a <|nl|> bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? <|nl|> Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if <|nl|> she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence <|nl|> on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the <|nl|> lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not <|nl|> bestraught: here's-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servant: <|nl|> O, this it is that makes your lady mourn! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> O, this is it that makes your servants droop! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house, <|nl|> As beaten hence by your strange lunacy. <|nl|> O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth, <|nl|> Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment <|nl|> And banish hence these abject lowly dreams. <|nl|> Look how thy servants do attend on thee, <|nl|> Each in his office ready at thy beck. <|nl|> Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays, <|nl|> And twenty caged nightingales do sing: <|nl|> Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch <|nl|> Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed <|nl|> On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis. <|nl|> Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground: <|nl|> Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd, <|nl|> Their harness studded all with gold and pearl. <|nl|> Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar <|nl|> Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt? <|nl|> Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them <|nl|> And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift <|nl|> As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight <|nl|> Adonis painted by a running brook, <|nl|> And Cytherea all in sedges hid, <|nl|> Which seem to move and wanton with her breath, <|nl|> Even as the waving sedges play with wind. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> We'll show thee Io as she was a maid, <|nl|> And how she was beguiled and surprised, <|nl|> As lively painted as the deed was done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servant: <|nl|> Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood, <|nl|> Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds, <|nl|> And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep, <|nl|> So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord: <|nl|> Thou hast a lady far more beautiful <|nl|> Than any woman in this waning age. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> And till the tears that she hath shed for thee <|nl|> Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face, <|nl|> She was the fairest creature in the world; <|nl|> And yet she is inferior to none. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Am I a lord? and have I such a lady? <|nl|> Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now? <|nl|> I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak; <|nl|> I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things: <|nl|> Upon my life, I am a lord indeed <|nl|> And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly. <|nl|> Well, bring our lady hither to our sight; <|nl|> And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Second Servant: <|nl|> Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands? <|nl|> O, how we joy to see your wit restored! <|nl|> O, that once more you knew but what you are! <|nl|> These fifteen years you have been in a dream; <|nl|> Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap. <|nl|> But did I never speak of all that time? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> O, yes, my lord, but very idle words: <|nl|> For though you lay here in this goodly chamber, <|nl|> Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door; <|nl|> And rail upon the hostess of the house; <|nl|> And say you would present her at the leet, <|nl|> Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts: <|nl|> Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Ay, the woman's maid of the house. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Third Servant: <|nl|> Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid, <|nl|> Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up, <|nl|> As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece <|nl|> And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell <|nl|> And twenty more such names and men as these <|nl|> Which never were nor no man ever saw. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Now Lord be thanked for my good amends! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALL: <|nl|> Amen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> How fares my noble lord? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough. <|nl|> Where is my wife? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Are you my wife and will not call me husband? <|nl|> My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> My husband and my lord, my lord and husband; <|nl|> I am your wife in all obedience. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> I know it well. What must I call her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> Madam. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Al'ce madam, or Joan madam? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Lord: <|nl|> 'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords <|nl|> call ladies. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd <|nl|> And slept above some fifteen year or more. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me, <|nl|> Being all this time abandon'd from your bed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> 'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone. <|nl|> Madam, undress you and come now to bed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you <|nl|> To pardon me yet for a night or two, <|nl|> Or, if not so, until the sun be set: <|nl|> For your physicians have expressly charged, <|nl|> In peril to incur your former malady, <|nl|> That I should yet absent me from your bed: <|nl|> I hope this reason stands for my excuse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Ay, it stands so that I may hardly <|nl|> tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into <|nl|> my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in <|nl|> despite of the flesh and the blood. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Messenger: <|nl|> Your honour's players, heating your amendment, <|nl|> Are come to play a pleasant comedy; <|nl|> For so your doctors hold it very meet, <|nl|> Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood, <|nl|> And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy: <|nl|> Therefore they thought it good you hear a play <|nl|> And frame your mind to mirth and merriment, <|nl|> Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a <|nl|> comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> What, household stuff? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> It is a kind of history. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side <|nl|> and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Tranio, since for the great desire I had <|nl|> To see fair Padua, nursery of arts, <|nl|> I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy, <|nl|> The pleasant garden of great Italy; <|nl|> And by my father's love and leave am arm'd <|nl|> With his good will and thy good company, <|nl|> My trusty servant, well approved in all, <|nl|> Here let us breathe and haply institute <|nl|> A course of learning and ingenious studies. <|nl|> Pisa renown'd for grave citizens <|nl|> Gave me my being and my father first, <|nl|> A merchant of great traffic through the world, <|nl|> Vincetino come of Bentivolii. <|nl|> Vincetino's son brought up in Florence <|nl|> It shall become to serve all hopes conceived, <|nl|> To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds: <|nl|> And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study, <|nl|> Virtue and that part of philosophy <|nl|> Will I apply that treats of happiness <|nl|> By virtue specially to be achieved. <|nl|> Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left <|nl|> And am to Padua come, as he that leaves <|nl|> A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep <|nl|> And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Mi perdonato, gentle master mine, <|nl|> I am in all affected as yourself; <|nl|> Glad that you thus continue your resolve <|nl|> To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy. <|nl|> Only, good master, while we do admire <|nl|> This virtue and this moral discipline, <|nl|> Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray; <|nl|> Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques <|nl|> As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured: <|nl|> Balk logic with acquaintance that you have <|nl|> And practise rhetoric in your common talk; <|nl|> Music and poesy use to quicken you; <|nl|> The mathematics and the metaphysics, <|nl|> Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you; <|nl|> No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en: <|nl|> In brief, sir, study what you most affect. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise. <|nl|> If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore, <|nl|> We could at once put us in readiness, <|nl|> And take a lodging fit to entertain <|nl|> Such friends as time in Padua shall beget. <|nl|> But stay a while: what company is this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Master, some show to welcome us to town. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Gentlemen, importune me no farther, <|nl|> For how I firmly am resolved you know; <|nl|> That is, not bestow my youngest daughter <|nl|> Before I have a husband for the elder: <|nl|> If either of you both love Katharina, <|nl|> Because I know you well and love you well, <|nl|> Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I pray you, sir, is it your will <|nl|> To make a stale of me amongst these mates? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you, <|nl|> Unless you were of gentler, milder mould. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear: <|nl|> I wis it is not half way to her heart; <|nl|> But if it were, doubt not her care should be <|nl|> To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool <|nl|> And paint your face and use you like a fool. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIA: <|nl|> From all such devils, good Lord deliver us! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> And me too, good Lord! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward: <|nl|> That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> But in the other's silence do I see <|nl|> Maid's mild behavior and sobriety. <|nl|> Peace, Tranio! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Gentlemen, that I may soon make good <|nl|> What I have said, Bianca, get you in: <|nl|> And let it not displease thee, good Bianca, <|nl|> For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> A pretty peat! it is best <|nl|> Put finger in the eye, an she knew why. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Sister, content you in my discontent. <|nl|> Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe: <|nl|> My books and instruments shall be my company, <|nl|> On them to took and practise by myself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Signior Baptista, will you be so strange? <|nl|> Sorry am I that our good will effects <|nl|> Bianca's grief. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Why will you mew her up, <|nl|> Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell, <|nl|> And make her bear the penance of her tongue? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved: <|nl|> Go in, Bianca: <|nl|> And for I know she taketh most delight <|nl|> In music, instruments and poetry, <|nl|> Schoolmasters will I keep within my house, <|nl|> Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio, <|nl|> Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such, <|nl|> Prefer them hither; for to cunning men <|nl|> I will be very kind, and liberal <|nl|> To mine own children in good bringing up: <|nl|> And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay; <|nl|> For I have more to commune with Bianca. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What, <|nl|> shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I <|nl|> knew not what to take and what to leave, ha? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so <|nl|> good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not <|nl|> so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails <|nl|> together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on <|nl|> both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my <|nl|> sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit <|nl|> man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will <|nl|> wish him to her father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray. <|nl|> Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked <|nl|> parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both, <|nl|> that we may yet again have access to our fair <|nl|> mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to <|nl|> labour and effect one thing specially. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> What's that, I pray? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> A husband! a devil. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> I say, a husband. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though <|nl|> her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool <|nl|> to be married to hell? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine <|nl|> to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good <|nl|> fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, <|nl|> would take her with all faults, and money enough. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with <|nl|> this condition, to be whipped at the high cross <|nl|> every morning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten <|nl|> apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us <|nl|> friends, it shall be so far forth friendly <|nl|> maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter <|nl|> to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, <|nl|> and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man <|nl|> be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. <|nl|> How say you, Signior Gremio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> I am agreed; and would I had given him the best <|nl|> horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would <|nl|> thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the <|nl|> house of her! Come on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible <|nl|> That love should of a sudden take such hold? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> O Tranio, till I found it to be true, <|nl|> I never thought it possible or likely; <|nl|> But see, while idly I stood looking on, <|nl|> I found the effect of love in idleness: <|nl|> And now in plainness do confess to thee, <|nl|> That art to me as secret and as dear <|nl|> As Anna to the queen of Carthage was, <|nl|> Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio, <|nl|> If I achieve not this young modest girl. <|nl|> Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst; <|nl|> Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Master, it is no time to chide you now; <|nl|> Affection is not rated from the heart: <|nl|> If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so, <|nl|> 'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents: <|nl|> The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Master, you look'd so longly on the maid, <|nl|> Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face, <|nl|> Such as the daughter of Agenor had, <|nl|> That made great Jove to humble him to her hand. <|nl|> When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister <|nl|> Began to scold and raise up such a storm <|nl|> That mortal ears might hardly endure the din? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move <|nl|> And with her breath she did perfume the air: <|nl|> Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance. <|nl|> I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid, <|nl|> Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands: <|nl|> Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd <|nl|> That till the father rid his hands of her, <|nl|> Master, your love must live a maid at home; <|nl|> And therefore has he closely mew'd her up, <|nl|> Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he! <|nl|> But art thou not advised, he took some care <|nl|> To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> I have it, Tranio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Master, for my hand, <|nl|> Both our inventions meet and jump in one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Tell me thine first. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> You will be schoolmaster <|nl|> And undertake the teaching of the maid: <|nl|> That's your device. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> It is: may it be done? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Not possible; for who shall bear your part, <|nl|> And be in Padua here Vincentio's son, <|nl|> Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends, <|nl|> Visit his countrymen and banquet them? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Basta; content thee, for I have it full. <|nl|> We have not yet been seen in any house, <|nl|> Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces <|nl|> For man or master; then it follows thus; <|nl|> Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead, <|nl|> Keep house and port and servants as I should: <|nl|> I will some other be, some Florentine, <|nl|> Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa. <|nl|> 'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once <|nl|> Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak: <|nl|> When Biondello comes, he waits on thee; <|nl|> But I will charm him first to keep his tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> So had you need. <|nl|> In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is, <|nl|> And I am tied to be obedient; <|nl|> For so your father charged me at our parting, <|nl|> 'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he, <|nl|> Although I think 'twas in another sense; <|nl|> I am content to be Lucentio, <|nl|> Because so well I love Lucentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves: <|nl|> And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid <|nl|> Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye. <|nl|> Here comes the rogue. <|nl|> Sirrah, where have you been? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you? <|nl|> Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or <|nl|> you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest, <|nl|> And therefore frame your manners to the time. <|nl|> Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life, <|nl|> Puts my apparel and my countenance on, <|nl|> And I for my escape have put on his; <|nl|> For in a quarrel since I came ashore <|nl|> I kill'd a man and fear I was descried: <|nl|> Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes, <|nl|> While I make way from hence to save my life: <|nl|> You understand me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> I, sir! ne'er a whit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth: <|nl|> Tranio is changed into Lucentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> The better for him: would I were so too! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, <|nl|> That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter. <|nl|> But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise <|nl|> You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies: <|nl|> When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio; <|nl|> But in all places else your master Lucentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that <|nl|> thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if <|nl|> thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good <|nl|> and weighty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely: <|nl|> comes there any more of it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Page: <|nl|> My lord, 'tis but begun. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SLY: <|nl|> 'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady: <|nl|> would 'twere done! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Verona, for a while I take my leave, <|nl|> To see my friends in Padua, but of all <|nl|> My best beloved and approved friend, <|nl|> Hortensio; and I trow this is his house. <|nl|> Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has <|nl|> rebused your worship? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Villain, I say, knock me here soundly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that <|nl|> I should knock you here, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Villain, I say, knock me at this gate <|nl|> And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock <|nl|> you first, <|nl|> And then I know after who comes by the worst. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Will it not be? <|nl|> Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it; <|nl|> I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Help, masters, help! my master is mad. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio! <|nl|> and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray? <|nl|> 'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> 'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor <|nl|> mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound <|nl|> this quarrel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. <|nl|> if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his <|nl|> service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap <|nl|> him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to <|nl|> use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see, <|nl|> two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had <|nl|> well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> A senseless villain! Good Hortensio, <|nl|> I bade the rascal knock upon your gate <|nl|> And could not get him for my heart to do it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these <|nl|> words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, <|nl|> knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you <|nl|> now with, 'knocking at the gate'? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge: <|nl|> Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you, <|nl|> Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio. <|nl|> And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale <|nl|> Blows you to Padua here from old Verona? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Such wind as scatters young men through the world, <|nl|> To seek their fortunes farther than at home <|nl|> Where small experience grows. But in a few, <|nl|> Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me: <|nl|> Antonio, my father, is deceased; <|nl|> And I have thrust myself into this maze, <|nl|> Haply to wive and thrive as best I may: <|nl|> Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home, <|nl|> And so am come abroad to see the world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee <|nl|> And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife? <|nl|> Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel: <|nl|> And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich <|nl|> And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend, <|nl|> And I'll not wish thee to her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we <|nl|> Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know <|nl|> One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife, <|nl|> As wealth is burden of my wooing dance, <|nl|> Be she as foul as was Florentius' love, <|nl|> As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd <|nl|> As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse, <|nl|> She moves me not, or not removes, at least, <|nl|> Affection's edge in me, were she as rough <|nl|> As are the swelling Adriatic seas: <|nl|> I come to wive it wealthily in Padua; <|nl|> If wealthily, then happily in Padua. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his <|nl|> mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to <|nl|> a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er <|nl|> a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases <|nl|> as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss, <|nl|> so money comes withal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in, <|nl|> I will continue that I broach'd in jest. <|nl|> I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife <|nl|> With wealth enough and young and beauteous, <|nl|> Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman: <|nl|> Her only fault, and that is faults enough, <|nl|> Is that she is intolerable curst <|nl|> And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure <|nl|> That, were my state far worser than it is, <|nl|> I would not wed her for a mine of gold. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect: <|nl|> Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough; <|nl|> For I will board her, though she chide as loud <|nl|> As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Her father is Baptista Minola, <|nl|> An affable and courteous gentleman: <|nl|> Her name is Katharina Minola, <|nl|> Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I know her father, though I know not her; <|nl|> And he knew my deceased father well. <|nl|> I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her; <|nl|> And therefore let me be thus bold with you <|nl|> To give you over at this first encounter, <|nl|> Unless you will accompany me thither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. <|nl|> O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she <|nl|> would think scolding would do little good upon him: <|nl|> she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so: <|nl|> why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in <|nl|> his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she <|nl|> stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in <|nl|> her face and so disfigure her with it that she <|nl|> shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. <|nl|> You know him not, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, <|nl|> For in Baptista's keep my treasure is: <|nl|> He hath the jewel of my life in hold, <|nl|> His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca, <|nl|> And her withholds from me and other more, <|nl|> Suitors to her and rivals in my love, <|nl|> Supposing it a thing impossible, <|nl|> For those defects I have before rehearsed, <|nl|> That ever Katharina will be woo'd; <|nl|> Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en, <|nl|> That none shall have access unto Bianca <|nl|> Till Katharina the curst have got a husband. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Katharina the curst! <|nl|> A title for a maid of all titles the worst. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace, <|nl|> And offer me disguised in sober robes <|nl|> To old Baptista as a schoolmaster <|nl|> Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca; <|nl|> That so I may, by this device, at least <|nl|> Have leave and leisure to make love to her <|nl|> And unsuspected court her by herself. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, <|nl|> how the young folks lay their heads together! <|nl|> Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love. <|nl|> Petruchio, stand by a while. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> A proper stripling and an amorous! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> O, very well; I have perused the note. <|nl|> Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound: <|nl|> All books of love, see that at any hand; <|nl|> And see you read no other lectures to her: <|nl|> You understand me: over and beside <|nl|> Signior Baptista's liberality, <|nl|> I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too, <|nl|> And let me have them very well perfumed <|nl|> For she is sweeter than perfume itself <|nl|> To whom they go to. What will you read to her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you <|nl|> As for my patron, stand you so assured, <|nl|> As firmly as yourself were still in place: <|nl|> Yea, and perhaps with more successful words <|nl|> Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> O this learning, what a thing it is! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> O this woodcock, what an ass it is! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Peace, sirrah! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> And you are well met, Signior Hortensio. <|nl|> Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola. <|nl|> I promised to inquire carefully <|nl|> About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca: <|nl|> And by good fortune I have lighted well <|nl|> On this young man, for learning and behavior <|nl|> Fit for her turn, well read in poetry <|nl|> And other books, good ones, I warrant ye. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> 'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman <|nl|> Hath promised me to help me to another, <|nl|> A fine musician to instruct our mistress; <|nl|> So shall I no whit be behind in duty <|nl|> To fair Bianca, so beloved of me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> And that his bags shall prove. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love: <|nl|> Listen to me, and if you speak me fair, <|nl|> I'll tell you news indifferent good for either. <|nl|> Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met, <|nl|> Upon agreement from us to his liking, <|nl|> Will undertake to woo curst Katharina, <|nl|> Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> So said, so done, is well. <|nl|> Hortensio, have you told him all her faults? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I know she is an irksome brawling scold: <|nl|> If that be all, masters, I hear no harm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Born in Verona, old Antonio's son: <|nl|> My father dead, my fortune lives for me; <|nl|> And I do hope good days and long to see. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange! <|nl|> But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name: <|nl|> You shall have me assisting you in all. <|nl|> But will you woo this wild-cat? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Will I live? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why came I hither but to that intent? <|nl|> Think you a little din can daunt mine ears? <|nl|> Have I not in my time heard lions roar? <|nl|> Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds <|nl|> Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat? <|nl|> Have I not heard great ordnance in the field, <|nl|> And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies? <|nl|> Have I not in a pitched battle heard <|nl|> Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang? <|nl|> And do you tell me of a woman's tongue, <|nl|> That gives not half so great a blow to hear <|nl|> As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire? <|nl|> Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> For he fears none. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Hortensio, hark: <|nl|> This gentleman is happily arrived, <|nl|> My mind presumes, for his own good and ours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> I promised we would be contributors <|nl|> And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> And so we will, provided that he win her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> I would I were as sure of a good dinner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold, <|nl|> Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way <|nl|> To the house of Signior Baptista Minola? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Even he, Biondello. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Hark you, sir; you mean not her to-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Well begun, Tranio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Sir, a word ere you go; <|nl|> Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> And if I be, sir, is it any offence? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> No; if without more words you will get you hence. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free <|nl|> For me as for you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> But so is not she. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> For what reason, I beseech you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> For this reason, if you'll know, <|nl|> That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen, <|nl|> Do me this right; hear me with patience. <|nl|> Baptista is a noble gentleman, <|nl|> To whom my father is not all unknown; <|nl|> And were his daughter fairer than she is, <|nl|> She may more suitors have and me for one. <|nl|> Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers; <|nl|> Then well one more may fair Bianca have: <|nl|> And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one, <|nl|> Though Paris came in hope to speed alone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> What! this gentleman will out-talk us all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Hortensio, to what end are all these words? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Sir, let me be so bold as ask you, <|nl|> Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two, <|nl|> The one as famous for a scolding tongue <|nl|> As is the other for beauteous modesty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules; <|nl|> And let it be more than Alcides' twelve. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Sir, understand you this of me in sooth: <|nl|> The youngest daughter whom you hearken for <|nl|> Her father keeps from all access of suitors, <|nl|> And will not promise her to any man <|nl|> Until the elder sister first be wed: <|nl|> The younger then is free and not before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> If it be so, sir, that you are the man <|nl|> Must stead us all and me amongst the rest, <|nl|> And if you break the ice and do this feat, <|nl|> Achieve the elder, set the younger free <|nl|> For our access, whose hap shall be to have her <|nl|> Will not so graceless be to be ingrate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Sir, you say well and well you do conceive; <|nl|> And since you do profess to be a suitor, <|nl|> You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman, <|nl|> To whom we all rest generally beholding. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof, <|nl|> Please ye we may contrive this afternoon, <|nl|> And quaff carouses to our mistress' health, <|nl|> And do as adversaries do in law, <|nl|> Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> The motion's good indeed and be it so, <|nl|> Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself, <|nl|> To make a bondmaid and a slave of me; <|nl|> That I disdain: but for these other gawds, <|nl|> Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself, <|nl|> Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat; <|nl|> Or what you will command me will I do, <|nl|> So well I know my duty to my elders. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell <|nl|> Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Believe me, sister, of all the men alive <|nl|> I never yet beheld that special face <|nl|> Which I could fancy more than any other. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> If you affect him, sister, here I swear <|nl|> I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have <|nl|> him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> O then, belike, you fancy riches more: <|nl|> You will have Gremio to keep you fair. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Is it for him you do envy me so? <|nl|> Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive <|nl|> You have but jested with me all this while: <|nl|> I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> If that be jest, then all the rest was so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence? <|nl|> Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps. <|nl|> Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her. <|nl|> For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit, <|nl|> Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee? <|nl|> When did she cross thee with a bitter word? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see <|nl|> She is your treasure, she must have a husband; <|nl|> I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day <|nl|> And for your love to her lead apes in hell. <|nl|> Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep <|nl|> Till I can find occasion of revenge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I? <|nl|> But who comes here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Good morrow, neighbour Baptista. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Good morrow, neighbour Gremio. <|nl|> God save you, gentlemen! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter <|nl|> Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> You are too blunt: go to it orderly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave. <|nl|> I am a gentleman of Verona, sir, <|nl|> That, hearing of her beauty and her wit, <|nl|> Her affability and bashful modesty, <|nl|> Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior, <|nl|> Am bold to show myself a forward guest <|nl|> Within your house, to make mine eye the witness <|nl|> Of that report which I so oft have heard. <|nl|> And, for an entrance to my entertainment, <|nl|> I do present you with a man of mine, <|nl|> Cunning in music and the mathematics, <|nl|> To instruct her fully in those sciences, <|nl|> Whereof I know she is not ignorant: <|nl|> Accept of him, or else you do me wrong: <|nl|> His name is Licio, born in Mantua. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake. <|nl|> But for my daughter Katharina, this I know, <|nl|> She is not for your turn, the more my grief. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I see you do not mean to part with her, <|nl|> Or else you like not of my company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Mistake me not; I speak but as I find. <|nl|> Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son, <|nl|> A man well known throughout all Italy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> I know him well: you are welcome for his sake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray, <|nl|> Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too: <|nl|> Baccare! you are marvellous forward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your <|nl|> wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am <|nl|> sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself, <|nl|> that have been more kindly beholding to you than <|nl|> any, freely give unto you this young scholar, <|nl|> that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning <|nl|> in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other <|nl|> in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray, <|nl|> accept his service. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. <|nl|> Welcome, good Cambio. <|nl|> But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger: <|nl|> may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own, <|nl|> That, being a stranger in this city here, <|nl|> Do make myself a suitor to your daughter, <|nl|> Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous. <|nl|> Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me, <|nl|> In the preferment of the eldest sister. <|nl|> This liberty is all that I request, <|nl|> That, upon knowledge of my parentage, <|nl|> I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo <|nl|> And free access and favour as the rest: <|nl|> And, toward the education of your daughters, <|nl|> I here bestow a simple instrument, <|nl|> And this small packet of Greek and Latin books: <|nl|> If you accept them, then their worth is great. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> A mighty man of Pisa; by report <|nl|> I know him well: you are very welcome, sir, <|nl|> Take you the lute, and you the set of books; <|nl|> You shall go see your pupils presently. <|nl|> Holla, within! <|nl|> Sirrah, lead these gentlemen <|nl|> To my daughters; and tell them both, <|nl|> These are their tutors: bid them use them well. <|nl|> We will go walk a little in the orchard, <|nl|> And then to dinner. You are passing welcome, <|nl|> And so I pray you all to think yourselves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste, <|nl|> And every day I cannot come to woo. <|nl|> You knew my father well, and in him me, <|nl|> Left solely heir to all his lands and goods, <|nl|> Which I have better'd rather than decreased: <|nl|> Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love, <|nl|> What dowry shall I have with her to wife? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> After my death the one half of my lands, <|nl|> And in possession twenty thousand crowns. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of <|nl|> Her widowhood, be it that she survive me, <|nl|> In all my lands and leases whatsoever: <|nl|> Let specialties be therefore drawn between us, <|nl|> That covenants may be kept on either hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd, <|nl|> That is, her love; for that is all in all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father, <|nl|> I am as peremptory as she proud-minded; <|nl|> And where two raging fires meet together <|nl|> They do consume the thing that feeds their fury: <|nl|> Though little fire grows great with little wind, <|nl|> Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all: <|nl|> So I to her and so she yields to me; <|nl|> For I am rough and woo not like a babe. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed! <|nl|> But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds, <|nl|> That shake not, though they blow perpetually. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> For fear, I promise you, if I look pale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> What, will my daughter prove a good musician? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> I think she'll sooner prove a soldier <|nl|> Iron may hold with her, but never lutes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me. <|nl|> I did but tell her she mistook her frets, <|nl|> And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering; <|nl|> When, with a most impatient devilish spirit, <|nl|> 'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume <|nl|> with them:' <|nl|> And, with that word, she struck me on the head, <|nl|> And through the instrument my pate made way; <|nl|> And there I stood amazed for a while, <|nl|> As on a pillory, looking through the lute; <|nl|> While she did call me rascal fiddler <|nl|> And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms, <|nl|> As had she studied to misuse me so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench; <|nl|> I love her ten times more than e'er I did: <|nl|> O, how I long to have some chat with her! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Well, go with me and be not so discomfited: <|nl|> Proceed in practise with my younger daughter; <|nl|> She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns. <|nl|> Signior Petruchio, will you go with us, <|nl|> Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I pray you do. <|nl|> I will attend her here, <|nl|> And woo her with some spirit when she comes. <|nl|> Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain <|nl|> She sings as sweetly as a nightingale: <|nl|> Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear <|nl|> As morning roses newly wash'd with dew: <|nl|> Say she be mute and will not speak a word; <|nl|> Then I'll commend her volubility, <|nl|> And say she uttereth piercing eloquence: <|nl|> If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks, <|nl|> As though she bid me stay by her a week: <|nl|> If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day <|nl|> When I shall ask the banns and when be married. <|nl|> But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak. <|nl|> Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing: <|nl|> They call me Katharina that do talk of me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate, <|nl|> And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst; <|nl|> But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom <|nl|> Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate, <|nl|> For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate, <|nl|> Take this of me, Kate of my consolation; <|nl|> Hearing thy mildness praised in every town, <|nl|> Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded, <|nl|> Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs, <|nl|> Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither <|nl|> Remove you hence: I knew you at the first <|nl|> You were a moveable. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, what's a moveable? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> A join'd-stool. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Asses are made to bear, and so are you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Women are made to bear, and so are you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> No such jade as you, if me you mean. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee; <|nl|> For, knowing thee to be but young and light-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Too light for such a swain as you to catch; <|nl|> And yet as heavy as my weight should be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Should be! should--buzz! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Well ta'en, and like a buzzard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> If I be waspish, best beware my sting. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> My remedy is then, to pluck it out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies, <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Who knows not where a wasp does <|nl|> wear his sting? In his tail. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> In his tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Whose tongue? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again, <|nl|> Good Kate; I am a gentleman. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> That I'll try. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> So may you lose your arms: <|nl|> If you strike me, you are no gentleman; <|nl|> And if no gentleman, why then no arms. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> What is your crest? a coxcomb? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> It is my fashion, when I see a crab. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> There is, there is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Then show it me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Had I a glass, I would. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> What, you mean my face? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Well aim'd of such a young one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Yet you are wither'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> 'Tis with cares. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I care not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle. <|nl|> 'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen, <|nl|> And now I find report a very liar; <|nl|> For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous, <|nl|> But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers: <|nl|> Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, <|nl|> Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will, <|nl|> Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk, <|nl|> But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers, <|nl|> With gentle conference, soft and affable. <|nl|> Why does the world report that Kate doth limp? <|nl|> O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig <|nl|> Is straight and slender and as brown in hue <|nl|> As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels. <|nl|> O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Did ever Dian so become a grove <|nl|> As Kate this chamber with her princely gait? <|nl|> O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate; <|nl|> And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Where did you study all this goodly speech? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> It is extempore, from my mother-wit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> A witty mother! witless else her son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Am I not wise? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Yes; keep you warm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed: <|nl|> And therefore, setting all this chat aside, <|nl|> Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented <|nl|> That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on; <|nl|> And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you. <|nl|> Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn; <|nl|> For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty, <|nl|> Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well, <|nl|> Thou must be married to no man but me; <|nl|> For I am he am born to tame you Kate, <|nl|> And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate <|nl|> Conformable as other household Kates. <|nl|> Here comes your father: never make denial; <|nl|> I must and will have Katharina to my wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> How but well, sir? how but well? <|nl|> It were impossible I should speed amiss. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Call you me daughter? now, I promise you <|nl|> You have show'd a tender fatherly regard, <|nl|> To wish me wed to one half lunatic; <|nl|> A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack, <|nl|> That thinks with oaths to face the matter out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world, <|nl|> That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her: <|nl|> If she be curst, it is for policy, <|nl|> For she's not froward, but modest as the dove; <|nl|> She is not hot, but temperate as the morn; <|nl|> For patience she will prove a second Grissel, <|nl|> And Roman Lucrece for her chastity: <|nl|> And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together, <|nl|> That upon Sunday is the wedding-day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee <|nl|> hang'd first. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself: <|nl|> If she and I be pleased, what's that to you? <|nl|> 'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone, <|nl|> That she shall still be curst in company. <|nl|> I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe <|nl|> How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate! <|nl|> She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss <|nl|> She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath, <|nl|> That in a twink she won me to her love. <|nl|> O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see, <|nl|> How tame, when men and women are alone, <|nl|> A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew. <|nl|> Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice, <|nl|> To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day. <|nl|> Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests; <|nl|> I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> I know not what to say: but give me your hands; <|nl|> God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Amen, say we: we will be witnesses. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu; <|nl|> I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace: <|nl|> We will have rings and things and fine array; <|nl|> And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part, <|nl|> And venture madly on a desperate mart. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you: <|nl|> 'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> The gain I seek is, quiet in the match. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch. <|nl|> But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter: <|nl|> Now is the day we long have looked for: <|nl|> I am your neighbour, and was suitor first. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> And I am one that love Bianca more <|nl|> Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Graybeard, thy love doth freeze. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> But thine doth fry. <|nl|> Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife: <|nl|> 'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both <|nl|> That can assure my daughter greatest dower <|nl|> Shall have my Bianca's love. <|nl|> Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> First, as you know, my house within the city <|nl|> Is richly furnished with plate and gold; <|nl|> Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands; <|nl|> My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry; <|nl|> In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns; <|nl|> In cypress chests my arras counterpoints, <|nl|> Costly apparel, tents, and canopies, <|nl|> Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl, <|nl|> Valance of Venice gold in needlework, <|nl|> Pewter and brass and all things that belong <|nl|> To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm <|nl|> I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail, <|nl|> Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls, <|nl|> And all things answerable to this portion. <|nl|> Myself am struck in years, I must confess; <|nl|> And if I die to-morrow, this is hers, <|nl|> If whilst I live she will be only mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me: <|nl|> I am my father's heir and only son: <|nl|> If I may have your daughter to my wife, <|nl|> I'll leave her houses three or four as good, <|nl|> Within rich Pisa walls, as any one <|nl|> Old Signior Gremio has in Padua; <|nl|> Besides two thousand ducats by the year <|nl|> Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure. <|nl|> What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Two thousand ducats by the year of land! <|nl|> My land amounts not to so much in all: <|nl|> That she shall have; besides an argosy <|nl|> That now is lying in Marseilles' road. <|nl|> What, have I choked you with an argosy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less <|nl|> Than three great argosies; besides two galliases, <|nl|> And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her, <|nl|> And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more; <|nl|> And she can have no more than all I have: <|nl|> If you like me, she shall have me and mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Why, then the maid is mine from all the world, <|nl|> By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> I must confess your offer is the best; <|nl|> And, let your father make her the assurance, <|nl|> She is your own; else, you must pardon me, <|nl|> if you should die before him, where's her dower? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> That's but a cavil: he is old, I young. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> And may not young men die, as well as old? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Well, gentlemen, <|nl|> I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know <|nl|> My daughter Katharina is to be married: <|nl|> Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca <|nl|> Be bride to you, if you this assurance; <|nl|> If not, Signior Gremio: <|nl|> And so, I take my leave, and thank you both. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Adieu, good neighbour. <|nl|> Now I fear thee not: <|nl|> Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool <|nl|> To give thee all, and in his waning age <|nl|> Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy! <|nl|> An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide! <|nl|> Yet I have faced it with a card of ten. <|nl|> 'Tis in my head to do my master good: <|nl|> I see no reason but supposed Lucentio <|nl|> Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;' <|nl|> And that's a wonder: fathers commonly <|nl|> Do get their children; but in this case of wooing, <|nl|> A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir: <|nl|> Have you so soon forgot the entertainment <|nl|> Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> But, wrangling pedant, this is <|nl|> The patroness of heavenly harmony: <|nl|> Then give me leave to have prerogative; <|nl|> And when in music we have spent an hour, <|nl|> Your lecture shall have leisure for as much. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Preposterous ass, that never read so far <|nl|> To know the cause why music was ordain'd! <|nl|> Was it not to refresh the mind of man <|nl|> After his studies or his usual pain? <|nl|> Then give me leave to read philosophy, <|nl|> And while I pause, serve in your harmony. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong, <|nl|> To strive for that which resteth in my choice: <|nl|> I am no breeching scholar in the schools; <|nl|> I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times, <|nl|> But learn my lessons as I please myself. <|nl|> And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down: <|nl|> Take you your instrument, play you the whiles; <|nl|> His lecture will be done ere you have tuned. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> That will be never: tune your instrument. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Where left we last? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Here, madam: <|nl|> 'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus; <|nl|> Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Construe them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> 'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am <|nl|> Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa, <|nl|> 'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love; <|nl|> 'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes <|nl|> a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,' <|nl|> bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might <|nl|> beguile the old pantaloon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Madam, my instrument's in tune. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Spit in the hole, man, and tune again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat <|nl|> Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I <|nl|> trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed <|nl|> he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,' <|nl|> despair not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Madam, 'tis now in tune. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> All but the base. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars. <|nl|> How fiery and forward our pedant is! <|nl|> Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love: <|nl|> Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> In time I may believe, yet I mistrust. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides <|nl|> Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> I must believe my master; else, I promise you, <|nl|> I should be arguing still upon that doubt: <|nl|> But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you: <|nl|> Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray, <|nl|> That I have been thus pleasant with you both. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> You may go walk, and give me leave a while: <|nl|> My lessons make no music in three parts. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait, <|nl|> And watch withal; for, but I be deceived, <|nl|> Our fine musician groweth amorous. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Madam, before you touch the instrument, <|nl|> To learn the order of my fingering, <|nl|> I must begin with rudiments of art; <|nl|> To teach you gamut in a briefer sort, <|nl|> More pleasant, pithy and effectual, <|nl|> Than hath been taught by any of my trade: <|nl|> And there it is in writing, fairly drawn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Why, I am past my gamut long ago. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Yet read the gamut of Hortensio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Servant: <|nl|> Mistress, your father prays you leave your books <|nl|> And help to dress your sister's chamber up: <|nl|> You know to-morrow is the wedding-day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> But I have cause to pry into this pedant: <|nl|> Methinks he looks as though he were in love: <|nl|> Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble <|nl|> To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale, <|nl|> Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging, <|nl|> Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced <|nl|> To give my hand opposed against my heart <|nl|> Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen; <|nl|> Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure. <|nl|> I told you, I, he was a frantic fool, <|nl|> Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior: <|nl|> And, to be noted for a merry man, <|nl|> He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage, <|nl|> Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns; <|nl|> Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd. <|nl|> Now must the world point at poor Katharina, <|nl|> And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife, <|nl|> If it would please him come and marry her!' <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too. <|nl|> Upon my life, Petruchio means but well, <|nl|> Whatever fortune stays him from his word: <|nl|> Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise; <|nl|> Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Would Katharina had never seen him though! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep; <|nl|> For such an injury would vex a very saint, <|nl|> Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Master, master! news, old news, and such news as <|nl|> you never heard of! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Is it new and old too? how may that be? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Is he come? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Why, no, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> What then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> He is coming. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> When will he be here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> When he stands where I am and sees you there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> But say, what to thine old news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old <|nl|> jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair <|nl|> of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, <|nl|> another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the <|nl|> town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; <|nl|> with two broken points: his horse hipped with an <|nl|> old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred; <|nl|> besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose <|nl|> in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected <|nl|> with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with <|nl|> spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives, <|nl|> stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the <|nl|> bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten; <|nl|> near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit <|nl|> and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being <|nl|> restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been <|nl|> often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth <|nl|> six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure, <|nl|> which hath two letters for her name fairly set down <|nl|> in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Who comes with him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned <|nl|> like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a <|nl|> kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red <|nl|> and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty <|nl|> fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a <|nl|> very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian <|nl|> footboy or a gentleman's lackey. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion; <|nl|> Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Why, sir, he comes not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Didst thou not say he comes? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Who? that Petruchio came? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Ay, that Petruchio came. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Why, that's all one. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Nay, by Saint Jamy, <|nl|> I hold you a penny, <|nl|> A horse and a man <|nl|> Is more than one, <|nl|> And yet not many. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Come, where be these gallants? who's at home? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> You are welcome, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> And yet I come not well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> And yet you halt not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Not so well apparell'd <|nl|> As I wish you were. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Were it better, I should rush in thus. <|nl|> But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride? <|nl|> How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown: <|nl|> And wherefore gaze this goodly company, <|nl|> As if they saw some wondrous monument, <|nl|> Some comet or unusual prodigy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day: <|nl|> First were we sad, fearing you would not come; <|nl|> Now sadder, that you come so unprovided. <|nl|> Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate, <|nl|> An eye-sore to our solemn festival! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> And tells us, what occasion of import <|nl|> Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife, <|nl|> And sent you hither so unlike yourself? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear: <|nl|> Sufficeth I am come to keep my word, <|nl|> Though in some part enforced to digress; <|nl|> Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse <|nl|> As you shall well be satisfied withal. <|nl|> But where is Kate? I stay too long from her: <|nl|> The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> See not your bride in these unreverent robes: <|nl|> Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> But thus, I trust, you will not marry her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words: <|nl|> To me she's married, not unto my clothes: <|nl|> Could I repair what she will wear in me, <|nl|> As I can change these poor accoutrements, <|nl|> 'Twere well for Kate and better for myself. <|nl|> But what a fool am I to chat with you, <|nl|> When I should bid good morrow to my bride, <|nl|> And seal the title with a lovely kiss! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> He hath some meaning in his mad attire: <|nl|> We will persuade him, be it possible, <|nl|> To put on better ere he go to church. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> I'll after him, and see the event of this. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> But to her love concerneth us to add <|nl|> Her father's liking: which to bring to pass, <|nl|> As I before unparted to your worship, <|nl|> I am to get a man,--whate'er he be, <|nl|> It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,-- <|nl|> And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa; <|nl|> And make assurance here in Padua <|nl|> Of greater sums than I have promised. <|nl|> So shall you quietly enjoy your hope, <|nl|> And marry sweet Bianca with consent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Were it not that my fellow-school-master <|nl|> Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly, <|nl|> 'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage; <|nl|> Which once perform'd, let all the world say no, <|nl|> I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> That by degrees we mean to look into, <|nl|> And watch our vantage in this business: <|nl|> We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio, <|nl|> The narrow-prying father, Minola, <|nl|> The quaint musician, amorous Licio; <|nl|> All for my master's sake, Lucentio. <|nl|> Signior Gremio, came you from the church? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> As willingly as e'er I came from school. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> And is the bride and bridegroom coming home? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed, <|nl|> A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him! <|nl|> I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest <|nl|> Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife, <|nl|> 'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud, <|nl|> That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book; <|nl|> And, as he stoop'd again to take it up, <|nl|> The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff <|nl|> That down fell priest and book and book and priest: <|nl|> 'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> What said the wench when he rose again? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore, <|nl|> As if the vicar meant to cozen him. <|nl|> But after many ceremonies done, <|nl|> He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if <|nl|> He had been aboard, carousing to his mates <|nl|> After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel <|nl|> And threw the sops all in the sexton's face; <|nl|> Having no other reason <|nl|> But that his beard grew thin and hungerly <|nl|> And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking. <|nl|> This done, he took the bride about the neck <|nl|> And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack <|nl|> That at the parting all the church did echo: <|nl|> And I seeing this came thence for very shame; <|nl|> And after me, I know, the rout is coming. <|nl|> Such a mad marriage never was before: <|nl|> Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains: <|nl|> I know you think to dine with me to-day, <|nl|> And have prepared great store of wedding cheer; <|nl|> But so it is, my haste doth call me hence, <|nl|> And therefore here I mean to take my leave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Is't possible you will away to-night? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I must away to-day, before night come: <|nl|> Make it no wonder; if you knew my business, <|nl|> You would entreat me rather go than stay. <|nl|> And, honest company, I thank you all, <|nl|> That have beheld me give away myself <|nl|> To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife: <|nl|> Dine with my father, drink a health to me; <|nl|> For I must hence; and farewell to you all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Let us entreat you stay till after dinner. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> It may not be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Let me entreat you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> It cannot be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Let me entreat you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I am content. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Are you content to stay? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I am content you shall entreat me stay; <|nl|> But yet not stay, entreat me how you can. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Now, if you love me, stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Grumio, my horse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Nay, then, <|nl|> Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day; <|nl|> No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself. <|nl|> The door is open, sir; there lies your way; <|nl|> You may be jogging whiles your boots are green; <|nl|> For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself: <|nl|> 'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom, <|nl|> That take it on you at the first so roundly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I will be angry: what hast thou to do? <|nl|> Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATARINA: <|nl|> Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner: <|nl|> I see a woman may be made a fool, <|nl|> If she had not a spirit to resist. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command. <|nl|> Obey the bride, you that attend on her; <|nl|> Go to the feast, revel and domineer, <|nl|> Carouse full measure to her maidenhead, <|nl|> Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves: <|nl|> But for my bonny Kate, she must with me. <|nl|> Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret; <|nl|> I will be master of what is mine own: <|nl|> She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house, <|nl|> My household stuff, my field, my barn, <|nl|> My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing; <|nl|> And here she stands, touch her whoever dare; <|nl|> I'll bring mine action on the proudest he <|nl|> That stops my way in Padua. Grumio, <|nl|> Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves; <|nl|> Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man. <|nl|> Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch <|nl|> thee, Kate: <|nl|> I'll buckler thee against a million. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Of all mad matches never was the like. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> That, being mad herself, she's madly mated. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Neighbours and friends, though bride and <|nl|> bridegroom wants <|nl|> For to supply the places at the table, <|nl|> You know there wants no junkets at the feast. <|nl|> Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place: <|nl|> And let Bianca take her sister's room. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and <|nl|> all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever <|nl|> man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent <|nl|> before to make a fire, and they are coming after to <|nl|> warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon <|nl|> hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my <|nl|> tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my <|nl|> belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but <|nl|> I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for, <|nl|> considering the weather, a taller man than I will <|nl|> take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Who is that calls so coldly? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide <|nl|> from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run <|nl|> but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast <|nl|> on no water. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou <|nl|> knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it <|nl|> hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and <|nl|> myself, fellow Curtis. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and <|nl|> so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a <|nl|> fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, <|nl|> whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon <|nl|> feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and <|nl|> therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for <|nl|> my master and mistress are almost frozen to death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as <|nl|> will thaw. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Come, you are so full of cony-catching! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold. <|nl|> Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house <|nl|> trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the <|nl|> serving-men in their new fustian, their white <|nl|> stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on? <|nl|> Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, <|nl|> the carpets laid, and every thing in order? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> First, know, my horse is tired; my master and <|nl|> mistress fallen out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> How? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby <|nl|> hangs a tale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Let's ha't, good Grumio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Lend thine ear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Here. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> There. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this <|nl|> cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech <|nl|> listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a <|nl|> foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Both of one horse? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> What's that to thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Why, a horse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me, <|nl|> thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she <|nl|> under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how <|nl|> miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her <|nl|> with the horse upon her, how he beat me because <|nl|> her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt <|nl|> to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed, <|nl|> that never prayed before, how I cried, how the <|nl|> horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I <|nl|> lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory, <|nl|> which now shall die in oblivion and thou return <|nl|> unexperienced to thy grave. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> By this reckoning he is more shrew than she. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall <|nl|> find when he comes home. But what talk I of this? <|nl|> Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, <|nl|> Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be <|nl|> sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their <|nl|> garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy <|nl|> with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair <|nl|> of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their <|nl|> hands. Are they all ready? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> They are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Call them forth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to <|nl|> countenance my mistress. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Why, she hath a face of her own. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> Who knows not that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Thou, it seems, that calls for company to <|nl|> countenance her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> I call them forth to credit her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NATHANIEL: <|nl|> Welcome home, Grumio! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PHILIP: <|nl|> How now, Grumio! <|nl|>  <|nl|> JOSEPH: <|nl|> What, Grumio! <|nl|>  <|nl|> NICHOLAS: <|nl|> Fellow Grumio! <|nl|>  <|nl|> NATHANIEL: <|nl|> How now, old lad? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow, <|nl|> you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce <|nl|> companions, is all ready, and all things neat? <|nl|>  <|nl|> NATHANIEL: <|nl|> All things is ready. How near is our master? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be <|nl|> not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Where be these knaves? What, no man at door <|nl|> To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse! <|nl|> Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALL SERVING-MEN: <|nl|> Here, here, sir; here, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! <|nl|> You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms! <|nl|> What, no attendance? no regard? no duty? <|nl|> Where is the foolish knave I sent before? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Here, sir; as foolish as I was before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge! <|nl|> Did I not bid thee meet me in the park, <|nl|> And bring along these rascal knaves with thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made, <|nl|> And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel; <|nl|> There was no link to colour Peter's hat, <|nl|> And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing: <|nl|> There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory; <|nl|> The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly; <|nl|> Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in. <|nl|> Where is the life that late I led-- <|nl|> Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.-- <|nl|> Sound, sound, sound, sound! <|nl|> Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry. <|nl|> Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when? <|nl|> It was the friar of orders grey, <|nl|> As he forth walked on his way:-- <|nl|> Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry: <|nl|> Take that, and mend the plucking off the other. <|nl|> Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho! <|nl|> Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence, <|nl|> And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither: <|nl|> One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with. <|nl|> Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water? <|nl|> Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily. <|nl|> You whoreson villain! will you let it fall? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave! <|nl|> Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach. <|nl|> Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I? <|nl|> What's this? mutton? <|nl|>  <|nl|> First Servant: <|nl|> Ay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Who brought it? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> I. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> 'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat. <|nl|> What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook? <|nl|> How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser, <|nl|> And serve it thus to me that love it not? <|nl|> Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all; <|nl|> You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves! <|nl|> What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet: <|nl|> The meat was well, if you were so contented. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away; <|nl|> And I expressly am forbid to touch it, <|nl|> For it engenders choler, planteth anger; <|nl|> And better 'twere that both of us did fast, <|nl|> Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric, <|nl|> Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh. <|nl|> Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended, <|nl|> And, for this night, we'll fast for company: <|nl|> Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber. <|nl|>  <|nl|> NATHANIEL: <|nl|> Peter, didst ever see the like? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETER: <|nl|> He kills her in her own humour. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Where is he? <|nl|>  <|nl|> CURTIS: <|nl|> In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her; <|nl|> And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul, <|nl|> Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak, <|nl|> And sits as one new-risen from a dream. <|nl|> Away, away! for he is coming hither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Thus have I politicly begun my reign, <|nl|> And 'tis my hope to end successfully. <|nl|> My falcon now is sharp and passing empty; <|nl|> And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged, <|nl|> For then she never looks upon her lure. <|nl|> Another way I have to man my haggard, <|nl|> To make her come and know her keeper's call, <|nl|> That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites <|nl|> That bate and beat and will not be obedient. <|nl|> She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat; <|nl|> Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not; <|nl|> As with the meat, some undeserved fault <|nl|> I'll find about the making of the bed; <|nl|> And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster, <|nl|> This way the coverlet, another way the sheets: <|nl|> Ay, and amid this hurly I intend <|nl|> That all is done in reverend care of her; <|nl|> And in conclusion she shall watch all night: <|nl|> And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl <|nl|> And with the clamour keep her still awake. <|nl|> This is a way to kill a wife with kindness; <|nl|> And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour. <|nl|> He that knows better how to tame a shrew, <|nl|> Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca <|nl|> Doth fancy any other but Lucentio? <|nl|> I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said, <|nl|> Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Now, mistress, profit you in what you read? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> What, master, read you? first resolve me that. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> I read that I profess, the Art to Love. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> And may you prove, sir, master of your art! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray, <|nl|> You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca <|nl|> Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> O despiteful love! unconstant womankind! <|nl|> I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Mistake no more: I am not Licio, <|nl|> Nor a musician, as I seem to be; <|nl|> But one that scorn to live in this disguise, <|nl|> For such a one as leaves a gentleman, <|nl|> And makes a god of such a cullion: <|nl|> Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Signior Hortensio, I have often heard <|nl|> Of your entire affection to Bianca; <|nl|> And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness, <|nl|> I will with you, if you be so contented, <|nl|> Forswear Bianca and her love for ever. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio, <|nl|> Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow <|nl|> Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her, <|nl|> As one unworthy all the former favours <|nl|> That I have fondly flatter'd her withal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> And here I take the unfeigned oath, <|nl|> Never to marry with her though she would entreat: <|nl|> Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Would all the world but he had quite forsworn! <|nl|> For me, that I may surely keep mine oath, <|nl|> I will be married to a wealthy widow, <|nl|> Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me <|nl|> As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard. <|nl|> And so farewell, Signior Lucentio. <|nl|> Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, <|nl|> Shall win my love: and so I take my leave, <|nl|> In resolution as I swore before. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace <|nl|> As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case! <|nl|> Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love, <|nl|> And have forsworn you with Hortensio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Mistress, we have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Then we are rid of Licio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now, <|nl|> That shall be wood and wedded in a day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> God give him joy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Ay, and he'll tame her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> He says so, Tranio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> The taming-school! what, is there such a place? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master; <|nl|> That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long, <|nl|> To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> O master, master, I have watch'd so long <|nl|> That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied <|nl|> An ancient angel coming down the hill, <|nl|> Will serve the turn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> What is he, Biondello? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Master, a mercatante, or a pedant, <|nl|> I know not what; but format in apparel, <|nl|> In gait and countenance surely like a father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> And what of him, Tranio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> If he be credulous and trust my tale, <|nl|> I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio, <|nl|> And give assurance to Baptista Minola, <|nl|> As if he were the right Vincentio <|nl|> Take in your love, and then let me alone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> God save you, sir! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> And you, sir! you are welcome. <|nl|> Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Sir, at the farthest for a week or two: <|nl|> But then up farther, and as for as Rome; <|nl|> And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> What countryman, I pray? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Of Mantua. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid! <|nl|> And come to Padua, careless of your life? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> 'Tis death for any one in Mantua <|nl|> To come to Padua. Know you not the cause? <|nl|> Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke, <|nl|> For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him, <|nl|> Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly: <|nl|> 'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come, <|nl|> You might have heard it else proclaim'd about. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so; <|nl|> For I have bills for money by exchange <|nl|> From Florence and must here deliver them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Well, sir, to do you courtesy, <|nl|> This will I do, and this I will advise you: <|nl|> First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been, <|nl|> Pisa renowned for grave citizens. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Among them know you one Vincentio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> I know him not, but I have heard of him; <|nl|> A merchant of incomparable wealth. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say, <|nl|> In countenance somewhat doth resemble you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> To save your life in this extremity, <|nl|> This favour will I do you for his sake; <|nl|> And think it not the worst of an your fortunes <|nl|> That you are like to Sir Vincentio. <|nl|> His name and credit shall you undertake, <|nl|> And in my house you shall be friendly lodged: <|nl|> Look that you take upon you as you should; <|nl|> You understand me, sir: so shall you stay <|nl|> Till you have done your business in the city: <|nl|> If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> O sir, I do; and will repute you ever <|nl|> The patron of my life and liberty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Then go with me to make the matter good. <|nl|> This, by the way, I let you understand; <|nl|> my father is here look'd for every day, <|nl|> To pass assurance of a dower in marriage <|nl|> 'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here: <|nl|> In all these circumstances I'll instruct you: <|nl|> Go with me to clothe you as becomes you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> The more my wrong, the more his spite appears: <|nl|> What, did he marry me to famish me? <|nl|> Beggars, that come unto my father's door, <|nl|> Upon entreaty have a present aims; <|nl|> If not, elsewhere they meet with charity: <|nl|> But I, who never knew how to entreat, <|nl|> Nor never needed that I should entreat, <|nl|> Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep, <|nl|> With oath kept waking and with brawling fed: <|nl|> And that which spites me more than all these wants, <|nl|> He does it under name of perfect love; <|nl|> As who should say, if I should sleep or eat, <|nl|> 'Twere deadly sickness or else present death. <|nl|> I prithee go and get me some repast; <|nl|> I care not what, so it be wholesome food. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> What say you to a neat's foot? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> 'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> I fear it is too choleric a meat. <|nl|> How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric. <|nl|> What say you to a piece of beef and mustard? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> A dish that I do love to feed upon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard, <|nl|> Or else you get no beef of Grumio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Why then, the mustard without the beef. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave, <|nl|> That feed'st me with the very name of meat: <|nl|> Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you, <|nl|> That triumph thus upon my misery! <|nl|> Go, get thee gone, I say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Mistress, what cheer? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Faith, as cold as can be. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me. <|nl|> Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am <|nl|> To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee: <|nl|> I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks. <|nl|> What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not; <|nl|> And all my pains is sorted to no proof. <|nl|> Here, take away this dish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I pray you, let it stand. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> The poorest service is repaid with thanks; <|nl|> And so shall mine, before you touch the meat. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I thank you, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame. <|nl|> Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Haberdasher: <|nl|> Here is the cap your worship did bespeak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, this was moulded on a porringer; <|nl|> A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy: <|nl|> Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell, <|nl|> A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap: <|nl|> Away with it! come, let me have a bigger. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time, <|nl|> And gentlewomen wear such caps as these <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> When you are gentle, you shall have one too, <|nl|> And not till then. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak; <|nl|> And speak I will; I am no child, no babe: <|nl|> Your betters have endured me say my mind, <|nl|> And if you cannot, best you stop your ears. <|nl|> My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, <|nl|> Or else my heart concealing it will break, <|nl|> And rather than it shall, I will be free <|nl|> Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap, <|nl|> A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie: <|nl|> I love thee well, in that thou likest it not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Love me or love me not, I like the cap; <|nl|> And it I will have, or I will have none. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't. <|nl|> O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here? <|nl|> What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon: <|nl|> What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart? <|nl|> Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash, <|nl|> Like to a censer in a barber's shop: <|nl|> Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|> You bid me make it orderly and well, <|nl|> According to the fashion and the time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd, <|nl|> I did not bid you mar it to the time. <|nl|> Go, hop me over every kennel home, <|nl|> For you shall hop without my custom, sir: <|nl|> I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I never saw a better-fashion'd gown, <|nl|> More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable: <|nl|> Belike you mean to make a puppet of me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|> She says your worship means to make <|nl|> a puppet of her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, <|nl|> thou thimble, <|nl|> Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail! <|nl|> Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou! <|nl|> Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread? <|nl|> Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant; <|nl|> Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard <|nl|> As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest! <|nl|> I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|> Your worship is deceived; the gown is made <|nl|> Just as my master had direction: <|nl|> Grumio gave order how it should be done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|> But how did you desire it should be made? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Marry, sir, with needle and thread. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|> But did you not request to have it cut? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Thou hast faced many things. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|> I have. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not <|nl|> me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto <|nl|> thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did <|nl|> not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|> Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Read it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in <|nl|> the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom <|nl|> of brown thread: I said a gown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Proceed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> I confess the cape. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> I confess two sleeves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Ay, there's the villany. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill. <|nl|> I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and <|nl|> sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee, <|nl|> though thy little finger be armed in a thimble. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Tailor: <|nl|> This is true that I say: an I had thee <|nl|> in place where, thou shouldst know it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> I am for thee straight: take thou the <|nl|> bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Go, take it up unto thy master's use. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress' <|nl|> gown for thy master's use! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, sir, what's your conceit in that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GRUMIO: <|nl|> O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for: <|nl|> Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use! <|nl|> O, fie, fie, fie! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow: <|nl|> Take no unkindness of his hasty words: <|nl|> Away! I say; commend me to thy master. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's <|nl|> Even in these honest mean habiliments: <|nl|> Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor; <|nl|> For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich; <|nl|> And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, <|nl|> So honour peereth in the meanest habit. <|nl|> What is the jay more precious than the lark, <|nl|> Because his fathers are more beautiful? <|nl|> Or is the adder better than the eel, <|nl|> Because his painted skin contents the eye? <|nl|> O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse <|nl|> For this poor furniture and mean array. <|nl|> if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me; <|nl|> And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith, <|nl|> To feast and sport us at thy father's house. <|nl|> Go, call my men, and let us straight to him; <|nl|> And bring our horses unto Long-lane end; <|nl|> There will we mount, and thither walk on foot <|nl|> Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock, <|nl|> And well we may come there by dinner-time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two; <|nl|> And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> It shall be seven ere I go to horse: <|nl|> Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do, <|nl|> You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone: <|nl|> I will not go to-day; and ere I do, <|nl|> It shall be what o'clock I say it is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Ay, what else? and but I be deceived <|nl|> Signior Baptista may remember me, <|nl|> Near twenty years ago, in Genoa, <|nl|> Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case, <|nl|> With such austerity as 'longeth to a father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> I warrant you. <|nl|> But, sir, here comes your boy; <|nl|> 'Twere good he were school'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello, <|nl|> Now do your duty throughly, I advise you: <|nl|> Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Tut, fear not me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> I told him that your father was at Venice, <|nl|> And that you look'd for him this day in Padua. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink. <|nl|> Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir. <|nl|> Signior Baptista, you are happily met. <|nl|> Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of: <|nl|> I pray you stand good father to me now, <|nl|> Give me Bianca for my patrimony. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Soft son! <|nl|> Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua <|nl|> To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio <|nl|> Made me acquainted with a weighty cause <|nl|> Of love between your daughter and himself: <|nl|> And, for the good report I hear of you <|nl|> And for the love he beareth to your daughter <|nl|> And she to him, to stay him not too long, <|nl|> I am content, in a good father's care, <|nl|> To have him match'd; and if you please to like <|nl|> No worse than I, upon some agreement <|nl|> Me shall you find ready and willing <|nl|> With one consent to have her so bestow'd; <|nl|> For curious I cannot be with you, <|nl|> Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Sir, pardon me in what I have to say: <|nl|> Your plainness and your shortness please me well. <|nl|> Right true it is, your son Lucentio here <|nl|> Doth love my daughter and she loveth him, <|nl|> Or both dissemble deeply their affections: <|nl|> And therefore, if you say no more than this, <|nl|> That like a father you will deal with him <|nl|> And pass my daughter a sufficient dower, <|nl|> The match is made, and all is done: <|nl|> Your son shall have my daughter with consent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best <|nl|> We be affied and such assurance ta'en <|nl|> As shall with either part's agreement stand? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know, <|nl|> Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants: <|nl|> Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still; <|nl|> And happily we might be interrupted. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Then at my lodging, an it like you: <|nl|> There doth my father lie; and there, this night, <|nl|> We'll pass the business privately and well. <|nl|> Send for your daughter by your servant here: <|nl|> My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently. <|nl|> The worst is this, that, at so slender warning, <|nl|> You are like to have a thin and slender pittance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home, <|nl|> And bid Bianca make her ready straight; <|nl|> And, if you will, tell what hath happened, <|nl|> Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua, <|nl|> And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> I pray the gods she may with all my heart! <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone. <|nl|> Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way? <|nl|> Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer: <|nl|> Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> I follow you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Cambio! <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> What sayest thou, Biondello? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> You saw my master wink and laugh upon you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Biondello, what of that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to <|nl|> expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> I pray thee, moralize them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the <|nl|> deceiving father of a deceitful son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> And what of him? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> And then? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your <|nl|> command at all hours. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> And what of all this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a <|nl|> counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her, <|nl|> 'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the <|nl|> church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient <|nl|> honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for, <|nl|> I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for <|nl|> ever and a day. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Hearest thou, Biondello? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an <|nl|> afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to <|nl|> stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu, <|nl|> sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint <|nl|> Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against <|nl|> you come with your appendix. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> I may, and will, if she be so contented: <|nl|> She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt? <|nl|> Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her: <|nl|> It shall go hard if Cambio go without her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's. <|nl|> Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I say it is the moon that shines so bright. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I know it is the sun that shines so bright. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself, <|nl|> It shall be moon, or star, or what I list, <|nl|> Or ere I journey to your father's house. <|nl|> Go on, and fetch our horses back again. <|nl|> Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Say as he says, or we shall never go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Forward, I pray, since we have come so far, <|nl|> And be it moon, or sun, or what you please: <|nl|> An if you please to call it a rush-candle, <|nl|> Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I say it is the moon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> I know it is the moon. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun: <|nl|> But sun it is not, when you say it is not; <|nl|> And the moon changes even as your mind. <|nl|> What you will have it named, even that it is; <|nl|> And so it shall be so for Katharina. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run, <|nl|> And not unluckily against the bias. <|nl|> But, soft! company is coming here. <|nl|> Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away? <|nl|> Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too, <|nl|> Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman? <|nl|> Such war of white and red within her cheeks! <|nl|> What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty, <|nl|> As those two eyes become that heavenly face? <|nl|> Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee. <|nl|> Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, <|nl|> Whither away, or where is thy abode? <|nl|> Happy the parents of so fair a child; <|nl|> Happier the man, whom favourable stars <|nl|> Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad: <|nl|> This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd, <|nl|> And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes, <|nl|> That have been so bedazzled with the sun <|nl|> That everything I look on seemeth green: <|nl|> Now I perceive thou art a reverend father; <|nl|> Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known <|nl|> Which way thou travellest: if along with us, <|nl|> We shall be joyful of thy company. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Fair sir, and you my merry mistress, <|nl|> That with your strange encounter much amazed me, <|nl|> My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa; <|nl|> And bound I am to Padua; there to visit <|nl|> A son of mine, which long I have not seen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> What is his name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Lucentio, gentle sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Happily we met; the happier for thy son. <|nl|> And now by law, as well as reverend age, <|nl|> I may entitle thee my loving father: <|nl|> The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman, <|nl|> Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not, <|nl|> Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem, <|nl|> Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth; <|nl|> Beside, so qualified as may beseem <|nl|> The spouse of any noble gentleman. <|nl|> Let me embrace with old Vincentio, <|nl|> And wander we to see thy honest son, <|nl|> Who will of thy arrival be full joyous. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> But is it true? or else is it your pleasure, <|nl|> Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest <|nl|> Upon the company you overtake? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> I do assure thee, father, so it is. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Come, go along, and see the truth hereof; <|nl|> For our first merriment hath made thee jealous. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart. <|nl|> Have to my widow! and if she be froward, <|nl|> Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee <|nl|> at home; therefore leave us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and <|nl|> then come back to my master's as soon as I can. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> I marvel Cambio comes not all this while. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house: <|nl|> My father's bears more toward the market-place; <|nl|> Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> You shall not choose but drink before you go: <|nl|> I think I shall command your welcome here, <|nl|> And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> They're busy within; you were best knock louder. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Is Signior Lucentio within, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to <|nl|> make merry withal? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall <|nl|> need none, so long as I live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. <|nl|> Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, <|nl|> I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is <|nl|> come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here <|nl|> looking out at the window. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Art thou his father? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to <|nl|> cozen somebody in this city under my countenance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> I have seen them in the church together: God send <|nl|> 'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old <|nl|> master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Hope I may choose, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I <|nl|> never saw you before in all my life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see <|nl|> thy master's father, Vincentio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir: <|nl|> see where he looks out of the window. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Is't so, indeed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Help, son! help, Signior Baptista! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of <|nl|> this controversy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal <|nl|> gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet <|nl|> hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I <|nl|> am undone! I am undone! while I play the good <|nl|> husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at <|nl|> the university. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> How now! what's the matter? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> What, is the man lunatic? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your <|nl|> habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir, <|nl|> what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I <|nl|> thank my good father, I am able to maintain it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do <|nl|> you think is his name? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought <|nl|> him up ever since he was three years old, and his <|nl|> name is Tranio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is <|nl|> mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold <|nl|> on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my <|nl|> son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Call forth an officer. <|nl|> Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, <|nl|> I charge you see that he be forthcoming. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Carry me to the gaol! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be <|nl|> cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this <|nl|> is the right Vincentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Pedant: <|nl|> Swear, if thou darest. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Nay, I dare not swear it. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O <|nl|> monstrous villain! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him, <|nl|> forswear him, or else we are all undone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Lives my sweet son? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Pardon, dear father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> How hast thou offended? <|nl|> Where is Lucentio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Here's Lucentio, <|nl|> Right son to the right Vincentio; <|nl|> That have by marriage made thy daughter mine, <|nl|> While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all! <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Where is that damned villain Tranio, <|nl|> That faced and braved me in this matter so? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Cambio is changed into Lucentio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love <|nl|> Made me exchange my state with Tranio, <|nl|> While he did bear my countenance in the town; <|nl|> And happily I have arrived at the last <|nl|> Unto the wished haven of my bliss. <|nl|> What Tranio did, myself enforced him to; <|nl|> Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent <|nl|> me to the gaol. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter <|nl|> without asking my good will? <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but <|nl|> I will in, to be revenged for this villany. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> And I, to sound the depth of this knavery. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest, <|nl|> Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> First kiss me, Kate, and we will. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> What, in the midst of the street? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> What, art thou ashamed of me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate: <|nl|> Better once than never, for never too late. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> At last, though long, our jarring notes agree: <|nl|> And time it is, when raging war is done, <|nl|> To smile at scapes and perils overblown. <|nl|> My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome, <|nl|> While I with self-same kindness welcome thine. <|nl|> Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina, <|nl|> And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow, <|nl|> Feast with the best, and welcome to my house: <|nl|> My banquet is to close our stomachs up, <|nl|> After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down; <|nl|> For now we sit to chat as well as eat. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Padua affords nothing but what is kind. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> For both our sakes, I would that word were true. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Widow: <|nl|> Then never trust me, if I be afeard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense: <|nl|> I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Widow: <|nl|> He that is giddy thinks the world turns round. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Roundly replied. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Mistress, how mean you that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Widow: <|nl|> Thus I conceive by him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> My widow says, thus she conceives her tale. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:' <|nl|> I pray you, tell me what you meant by that. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Widow: <|nl|> Your husband, being troubled with a shrew, <|nl|> Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe: <|nl|> And now you know my meaning, <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> A very mean meaning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Widow: <|nl|> Right, I mean you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> And I am mean indeed, respecting you. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> To her, Kate! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> To her, widow! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> That's my office. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Believe me, sir, they butt together well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body <|nl|> Would say your head and butt were head and horn. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun, <|nl|> Have at you for a bitter jest or two! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush; <|nl|> And then pursue me as you draw your bow. <|nl|> You are welcome all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio. <|nl|> This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not; <|nl|> Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound, <|nl|> Which runs himself and catches for his master. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> A good swift simile, but something currish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> TRANIO: <|nl|> 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself: <|nl|> 'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> A' has a little gall'd me, I confess; <|nl|> And, as the jest did glance away from me, <|nl|> 'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio, <|nl|> I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance <|nl|> Let's each one send unto his wife; <|nl|> And he whose wife is most obedient <|nl|> To come at first when he doth send for her, <|nl|> Shall win the wager which we will propose. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Content. What is the wager? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Twenty crowns. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Twenty crowns! <|nl|> I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound, <|nl|> But twenty times so much upon my wife. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> A hundred then. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Content. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> A match! 'tis done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Who shall begin? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> That will I. <|nl|> Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> I go. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself. <|nl|> How now! what news? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> Sir, my mistress sends you word <|nl|> That she is busy and she cannot come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> How! she is busy and she cannot come! <|nl|> Is that an answer? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GREMIO: <|nl|> Ay, and a kind one too: <|nl|> Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I hope better. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife <|nl|> To come to me forthwith. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> O, ho! entreat her! <|nl|> Nay, then she must needs come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> I am afraid, sir, <|nl|> Do what you can, yours will not be entreated. <|nl|> Now, where's my wife? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIONDELLO: <|nl|> She says you have some goodly jest in hand: <|nl|> She will not come: she bids you come to her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile, <|nl|> Intolerable, not to be endured! <|nl|> Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress; <|nl|> Say, I command her to come to me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> I know her answer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> What? <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> She will not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> The fouler fortune mine, and there an end. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina! <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> What is your will, sir, that you send for me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife? <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> They sit conferring by the parlor fire. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come. <|nl|> Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands: <|nl|> Away, I say, and bring them hither straight. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder. <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> And so it is: I wonder what it bodes. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life, <|nl|> And awful rule and right supremacy; <|nl|> And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> BAPTISTA: <|nl|> Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio! <|nl|> The wager thou hast won; and I will add <|nl|> Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns; <|nl|> Another dowry to another daughter, <|nl|> For she is changed, as she had never been. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Nay, I will win my wager better yet <|nl|> And show more sign of her obedience, <|nl|> Her new-built virtue and obedience. <|nl|> See where she comes and brings your froward wives <|nl|> As prisoners to her womanly persuasion. <|nl|> Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not: <|nl|> Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Widow: <|nl|> Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, <|nl|> Till I be brought to such a silly pass! <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> Fie! what a foolish duty call you this? <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> I would your duty were as foolish too: <|nl|> The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca, <|nl|> Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> BIANCA: <|nl|> The more fool you, for laying on my duty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women <|nl|> What duty they do owe their lords and husbands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Widow: <|nl|> Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Come on, I say; and first begin with her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Widow: <|nl|> She shall not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> I say she shall: and first begin with her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> KATHARINA: <|nl|> Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow, <|nl|> And dart not scornful glances from those eyes, <|nl|> To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor: <|nl|> It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads, <|nl|> Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds, <|nl|> And in no sense is meet or amiable. <|nl|> A woman moved is like a fountain troubled, <|nl|> Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty; <|nl|> And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty <|nl|> Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it. <|nl|> Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, <|nl|> Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee, <|nl|> And for thy maintenance commits his body <|nl|> To painful labour both by sea and land, <|nl|> To watch the night in storms, the day in cold, <|nl|> Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe; <|nl|> And craves no other tribute at thy hands <|nl|> But love, fair looks and true obedience; <|nl|> Too little payment for so great a debt. <|nl|> Such duty as the subject owes the prince <|nl|> Even such a woman oweth to her husband; <|nl|> And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour, <|nl|> And not obedient to his honest will, <|nl|> What is she but a foul contending rebel <|nl|> And graceless traitor to her loving lord? <|nl|> I am ashamed that women are so simple <|nl|> To offer war where they should kneel for peace; <|nl|> Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway, <|nl|> When they are bound to serve, love and obey. <|nl|> Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, <|nl|> Unapt to toil and trouble in the world, <|nl|> But that our soft conditions and our hearts <|nl|> Should well agree with our external parts? <|nl|> Come, come, you froward and unable worms! <|nl|> My mind hath been as big as one of yours, <|nl|> My heart as great, my reason haply more, <|nl|> To bandy word for word and frown for frown; <|nl|> But now I see our lances are but straws, <|nl|> Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, <|nl|> That seeming to be most which we indeed least are. <|nl|> Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot, <|nl|> And place your hands below your husband's foot: <|nl|> In token of which duty, if he please, <|nl|> My hand is ready; may it do him ease. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> VINCENTIO: <|nl|> 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> But a harsh hearing when women are froward. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PETRUCHIO: <|nl|> Come, Kate, we'll to bed. <|nl|> We three are married, but you two are sped. <|nl|> 'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white; <|nl|> And, being a winner, God give you good night! <|nl|>  <|nl|> HORTENSIO: <|nl|> Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew. <|nl|>  <|nl|> LUCENTIO: <|nl|> 'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Master: <|nl|> Boatswain! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> Here, master: what cheer? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Master: <|nl|> Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, <|nl|> or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! <|nl|> yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the <|nl|> master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, <|nl|> if room enough! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? <|nl|> Play the men. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> I pray now, keep below. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Where is the master, boatswain? <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your <|nl|> cabins: you do assist the storm. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Nay, good, be patient. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers <|nl|> for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> None that I more love than myself. You are a <|nl|> counsellor; if you can command these elements to <|nl|> silence, and work the peace of the present, we will <|nl|> not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you <|nl|> cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make <|nl|> yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of <|nl|> the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out <|nl|> of our way, I say. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he <|nl|> hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is <|nl|> perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his <|nl|> hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable, <|nl|> for our own doth little advantage. If he be not <|nl|> born to be hanged, our case is miserable. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring <|nl|> her to try with main-course. <|nl|> A plague upon this howling! they are louder than <|nl|> the weather or our office. <|nl|> Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er <|nl|> and drown? Have you a mind to sink? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, <|nl|> incharitable dog! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> Work you then. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! <|nl|> We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were <|nl|> no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an <|nl|> unstanched wench. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to <|nl|> sea again; lay her off. <|nl|>  <|nl|> Mariners: <|nl|> All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost! <|nl|>  <|nl|> Boatswain: <|nl|> What, must our mouths be cold? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them, <|nl|> For our case is as theirs. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> I'm out of patience. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards: <|nl|> This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning <|nl|> The washing of ten tides! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> He'll be hang'd yet, <|nl|> Though every drop of water swear against it <|nl|> And gape at widest to glut him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Let's all sink with the king. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Let's take leave of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an <|nl|> acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any <|nl|> thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain <|nl|> die a dry death. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> If by your art, my dearest father, you have <|nl|> Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. <|nl|> The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, <|nl|> But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, <|nl|> Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered <|nl|> With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel, <|nl|> Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, <|nl|> Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock <|nl|> Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd. <|nl|> Had I been any god of power, I would <|nl|> Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere <|nl|> It should the good ship so have swallow'd and <|nl|> The fraughting souls within her. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Be collected: <|nl|> No more amazement: tell your piteous heart <|nl|> There's no harm done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> O, woe the day! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> No harm. <|nl|> I have done nothing but in care of thee, <|nl|> Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who <|nl|> Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing <|nl|> Of whence I am, nor that I am more better <|nl|> Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, <|nl|> And thy no greater father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> More to know <|nl|> Did never meddle with my thoughts. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> 'Tis time <|nl|> I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand, <|nl|> And pluck my magic garment from me. So: <|nl|> Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort. <|nl|> The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd <|nl|> The very virtue of compassion in thee, <|nl|> I have with such provision in mine art <|nl|> So safely ordered that there is no soul-- <|nl|> No, not so much perdition as an hair <|nl|> Betid to any creature in the vessel <|nl|> Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down; <|nl|> For thou must now know farther. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> You have often <|nl|> Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd <|nl|> And left me to a bootless inquisition, <|nl|> Concluding 'Stay: not yet.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> The hour's now come; <|nl|> The very minute bids thee ope thine ear; <|nl|> Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember <|nl|> A time before we came unto this cell? <|nl|> I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not <|nl|> Out three years old. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Certainly, sir, I can. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> By what? by any other house or person? <|nl|> Of any thing the image tell me that <|nl|> Hath kept with thy remembrance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> 'Tis far off <|nl|> And rather like a dream than an assurance <|nl|> That my remembrance warrants. Had I not <|nl|> Four or five women once that tended me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it <|nl|> That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else <|nl|> In the dark backward and abysm of time? <|nl|> If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here, <|nl|> How thou camest here thou mayst. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> But that I do not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, <|nl|> Thy father was the Duke of Milan and <|nl|> A prince of power. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Sir, are not you my father? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and <|nl|> She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father <|nl|> Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir <|nl|> And princess no worse issued. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> O the heavens! <|nl|> What foul play had we, that we came from thence? <|nl|> Or blessed was't we did? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Both, both, my girl: <|nl|> By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence, <|nl|> But blessedly holp hither. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> O, my heart bleeds <|nl|> To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to, <|nl|> Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio-- <|nl|> I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should <|nl|> Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself <|nl|> Of all the world I loved and to him put <|nl|> The manage of my state; as at that time <|nl|> Through all the signories it was the first <|nl|> And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed <|nl|> In dignity, and for the liberal arts <|nl|> Without a parallel; those being all my study, <|nl|> The government I cast upon my brother <|nl|> And to my state grew stranger, being transported <|nl|> And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-- <|nl|> Dost thou attend me? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Sir, most heedfully. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Being once perfected how to grant suits, <|nl|> How to deny them, who to advance and who <|nl|> To trash for over-topping, new created <|nl|> The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em, <|nl|> Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key <|nl|> Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state <|nl|> To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was <|nl|> The ivy which had hid my princely trunk, <|nl|> And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> O, good sir, I do. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> I pray thee, mark me. <|nl|> I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated <|nl|> To closeness and the bettering of my mind <|nl|> With that which, but by being so retired, <|nl|> O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother <|nl|> Awaked an evil nature; and my trust, <|nl|> Like a good parent, did beget of him <|nl|> A falsehood in its contrary as great <|nl|> As my trust was; which had indeed no limit, <|nl|> A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, <|nl|> Not only with what my revenue yielded, <|nl|> But what my power might else exact, like one <|nl|> Who having into truth, by telling of it, <|nl|> Made such a sinner of his memory, <|nl|> To credit his own lie, he did believe <|nl|> He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution <|nl|> And executing the outward face of royalty, <|nl|> With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing-- <|nl|> Dost thou hear? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> To have no screen between this part he play'd <|nl|> And him he play'd it for, he needs will be <|nl|> Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library <|nl|> Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties <|nl|> He thinks me now incapable; confederates-- <|nl|> So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples <|nl|> To give him annual tribute, do him homage, <|nl|> Subject his coronet to his crown and bend <|nl|> The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!-- <|nl|> To most ignoble stooping. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> O the heavens! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Mark his condition and the event; then tell me <|nl|> If this might be a brother. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> I should sin <|nl|> To think but nobly of my grandmother: <|nl|> Good wombs have borne bad sons. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Now the condition. <|nl|> The King of Naples, being an enemy <|nl|> To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit; <|nl|> Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises <|nl|> Of homage and I know not how much tribute, <|nl|> Should presently extirpate me and mine <|nl|> Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan <|nl|> With all the honours on my brother: whereon, <|nl|> A treacherous army levied, one midnight <|nl|> Fated to the purpose did Antonio open <|nl|> The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness, <|nl|> The ministers for the purpose hurried thence <|nl|> Me and thy crying self. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Alack, for pity! <|nl|> I, not remembering how I cried out then, <|nl|> Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint <|nl|> That wrings mine eyes to't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Hear a little further <|nl|> And then I'll bring thee to the present business <|nl|> Which now's upon's; without the which this story <|nl|> Were most impertinent. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Wherefore did they not <|nl|> That hour destroy us? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Well demanded, wench: <|nl|> My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, <|nl|> So dear the love my people bore me, nor set <|nl|> A mark so bloody on the business, but <|nl|> With colours fairer painted their foul ends. <|nl|> In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, <|nl|> Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared <|nl|> A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd, <|nl|> Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats <|nl|> Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us, <|nl|> To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh <|nl|> To the winds whose pity, sighing back again, <|nl|> Did us but loving wrong. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Alack, what trouble <|nl|> Was I then to you! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> O, a cherubim <|nl|> Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile. <|nl|> Infused with a fortitude from heaven, <|nl|> When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt, <|nl|> Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me <|nl|> An undergoing stomach, to bear up <|nl|> Against what should ensue. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> How came we ashore? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> By Providence divine. <|nl|> Some food we had and some fresh water that <|nl|> A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, <|nl|> Out of his charity, being then appointed <|nl|> Master of this design, did give us, with <|nl|> Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries, <|nl|> Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness, <|nl|> Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me <|nl|> From mine own library with volumes that <|nl|> I prize above my dukedom. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Would I might <|nl|> But ever see that man! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Now I arise: <|nl|> Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. <|nl|> Here in this island we arrived; and here <|nl|> Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit <|nl|> Than other princesses can that have more time <|nl|> For vainer hours and tutors not so careful. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir, <|nl|> For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason <|nl|> For raising this sea-storm? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Know thus far forth. <|nl|> By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, <|nl|> Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies <|nl|> Brought to this shore; and by my prescience <|nl|> I find my zenith doth depend upon <|nl|> A most auspicious star, whose influence <|nl|> If now I court not but omit, my fortunes <|nl|> Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions: <|nl|> Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness, <|nl|> And give it way: I know thou canst not choose. <|nl|> Come away, servant, come. I am ready now. <|nl|> Approach, my Ariel, come. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come <|nl|> To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, <|nl|> To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride <|nl|> On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task <|nl|> Ariel and all his quality. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Hast thou, spirit, <|nl|> Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> To every article. <|nl|> I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak, <|nl|> Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, <|nl|> I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide, <|nl|> And burn in many places; on the topmast, <|nl|> The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, <|nl|> Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors <|nl|> O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary <|nl|> And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks <|nl|> Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune <|nl|> Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, <|nl|> Yea, his dread trident shake. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> My brave spirit! <|nl|> Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil <|nl|> Would not infect his reason? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Not a soul <|nl|> But felt a fever of the mad and play'd <|nl|> Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners <|nl|> Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, <|nl|> Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand, <|nl|> With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,-- <|nl|> Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty <|nl|> And all the devils are here.' <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Why that's my spirit! <|nl|> But was not this nigh shore? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Close by, my master. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> But are they, Ariel, safe? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Not a hair perish'd; <|nl|> On their sustaining garments not a blemish, <|nl|> But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me, <|nl|> In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle. <|nl|> The king's son have I landed by himself; <|nl|> Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs <|nl|> In an odd angle of the isle and sitting, <|nl|> His arms in this sad knot. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Of the king's ship <|nl|> The mariners say how thou hast disposed <|nl|> And all the rest o' the fleet. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Safely in harbour <|nl|> Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once <|nl|> Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew <|nl|> From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid: <|nl|> The mariners all under hatches stow'd; <|nl|> Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour, <|nl|> I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet <|nl|> Which I dispersed, they all have met again <|nl|> And are upon the Mediterranean flote, <|nl|> Bound sadly home for Naples, <|nl|> Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd <|nl|> And his great person perish. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Ariel, thy charge <|nl|> Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work. <|nl|> What is the time o' the day? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Past the mid season. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now <|nl|> Must by us both be spent most preciously. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, <|nl|> Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, <|nl|> Which is not yet perform'd me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> How now? moody? <|nl|> What is't thou canst demand? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> My liberty. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Before the time be out? no more! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> I prithee, <|nl|> Remember I have done thee worthy service; <|nl|> Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served <|nl|> Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise <|nl|> To bate me a full year. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Dost thou forget <|nl|> From what a torment I did free thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> No. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze <|nl|> Of the salt deep, <|nl|> To run upon the sharp wind of the north, <|nl|> To do me business in the veins o' the earth <|nl|> When it is baked with frost. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> I do not, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot <|nl|> The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy <|nl|> Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> No, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Sir, in Argier. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> O, was she so? I must <|nl|> Once in a month recount what thou hast been, <|nl|> Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax, <|nl|> For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible <|nl|> To enter human hearing, from Argier, <|nl|> Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did <|nl|> They would not take her life. Is not this true? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Ay, sir. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child <|nl|> And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave, <|nl|> As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant; <|nl|> And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate <|nl|> To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands, <|nl|> Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, <|nl|> By help of her more potent ministers <|nl|> And in her most unmitigable rage, <|nl|> Into a cloven pine; within which rift <|nl|> Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain <|nl|> A dozen years; within which space she died <|nl|> And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans <|nl|> As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-- <|nl|> Save for the son that she did litter here, <|nl|> A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with <|nl|> A human shape. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Yes, Caliban her son. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban <|nl|> Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st <|nl|> What torment I did find thee in; thy groans <|nl|> Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts <|nl|> Of ever angry bears: it was a torment <|nl|> To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax <|nl|> Could not again undo: it was mine art, <|nl|> When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape <|nl|> The pine and let thee out. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> I thank thee, master. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak <|nl|> And peg thee in his knotty entrails till <|nl|> Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> Pardon, master; <|nl|> I will be correspondent to command <|nl|> And do my spiriting gently. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Do so, and after two days <|nl|> I will discharge thee. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> That's my noble master! <|nl|> What shall I do? say what; what shall I do? <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject <|nl|> To no sight but thine and mine, invisible <|nl|> To every eyeball else. Go take this shape <|nl|> And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence! <|nl|> Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake! <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> The strangeness of your story put <|nl|> Heaviness in me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Shake it off. Come on; <|nl|> We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never <|nl|> Yields us kind answer. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> 'Tis a villain, sir, <|nl|> I do not love to look on. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> But, as 'tis, <|nl|> We cannot miss him: he does make our fire, <|nl|> Fetch in our wood and serves in offices <|nl|> That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban! <|nl|> Thou earth, thou! speak. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CALIBAN: <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee: <|nl|> Come, thou tortoise! when? <|nl|> Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel, <|nl|> Hark in thine ear. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> My lord it shall be done. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself <|nl|> Upon thy wicked dam, come forth! <|nl|>  <|nl|> CALIBAN: <|nl|> As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd <|nl|> With raven's feather from unwholesome fen <|nl|> Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye <|nl|> And blister you all o'er! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps, <|nl|> Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins <|nl|> Shall, for that vast of night that they may work, <|nl|> All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd <|nl|> As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging <|nl|> Than bees that made 'em. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CALIBAN: <|nl|> I must eat my dinner. <|nl|> This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, <|nl|> Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first, <|nl|> Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me <|nl|> Water with berries in't, and teach me how <|nl|> To name the bigger light, and how the less, <|nl|> That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee <|nl|> And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle, <|nl|> The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile: <|nl|> Cursed be I that did so! All the charms <|nl|> Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! <|nl|> For I am all the subjects that you have, <|nl|> Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me <|nl|> In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me <|nl|> The rest o' the island. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Thou most lying slave, <|nl|> Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee, <|nl|> Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee <|nl|> In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate <|nl|> The honour of my child. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CALIBAN: <|nl|> O ho, O ho! would't had been done! <|nl|> Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else <|nl|> This isle with Calibans. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Abhorred slave, <|nl|> Which any print of goodness wilt not take, <|nl|> Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee, <|nl|> Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour <|nl|> One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage, <|nl|> Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like <|nl|> A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes <|nl|> With words that made them known. But thy vile race, <|nl|> Though thou didst learn, had that in't which <|nl|> good natures <|nl|> Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou <|nl|> Deservedly confined into this rock, <|nl|> Who hadst deserved more than a prison. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CALIBAN: <|nl|> You taught me language; and my profit on't <|nl|> Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you <|nl|> For learning me your language! <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Hag-seed, hence! <|nl|> Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best, <|nl|> To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice? <|nl|> If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly <|nl|> What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps, <|nl|> Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar <|nl|> That beasts shall tremble at thy din. <|nl|>  <|nl|> CALIBAN: <|nl|> No, pray thee. <|nl|> I must obey: his art is of such power, <|nl|> It would control my dam's god, Setebos, <|nl|> and make a vassal of him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> So, slave; hence! <|nl|> Come unto these yellow sands, <|nl|> And then take hands: <|nl|> Courtsied when you have and kiss'd <|nl|> The wild waves whist, <|nl|> Foot it featly here and there; <|nl|> And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear. <|nl|> Hark, hark! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth? <|nl|> It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon <|nl|> Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank, <|nl|> Weeping again the king my father's wreck, <|nl|> This music crept by me upon the waters, <|nl|> Allaying both their fury and my passion <|nl|> With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it, <|nl|> Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone. <|nl|> No, it begins again. <|nl|> Full fathom five thy father lies; <|nl|> Of his bones are coral made; <|nl|> Those are pearls that were his eyes: <|nl|> Nothing of him that doth fade <|nl|> But doth suffer a sea-change <|nl|> Into something rich and strange. <|nl|> Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell <|nl|> Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> The ditty does remember my drown'd father. <|nl|> This is no mortal business, nor no sound <|nl|> That the earth owes. I hear it now above me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> The fringed curtains of thine eye advance <|nl|> And say what thou seest yond. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> What is't? a spirit? <|nl|> Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, <|nl|> It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses <|nl|> As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest <|nl|> Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd <|nl|> With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him <|nl|> A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows <|nl|> And strays about to find 'em. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> I might call him <|nl|> A thing divine, for nothing natural <|nl|> I ever saw so noble. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> Most sure, the goddess <|nl|> On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer <|nl|> May know if you remain upon this island; <|nl|> And that you will some good instruction give <|nl|> How I may bear me here: my prime request, <|nl|> Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder! <|nl|> If you be maid or no? <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> No wonder, sir; <|nl|> But certainly a maid. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> My language! heavens! <|nl|> I am the best of them that speak this speech, <|nl|> Were I but where 'tis spoken. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> How? the best? <|nl|> What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> A single thing, as I am now, that wonders <|nl|> To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me; <|nl|> And that he does I weep: myself am Naples, <|nl|> Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld <|nl|> The king my father wreck'd. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Alack, for mercy! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan <|nl|> And his brave son being twain. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Why speaks my father so ungently? This <|nl|> Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first <|nl|> That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father <|nl|> To be inclined my way! <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> O, if a virgin, <|nl|> And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you <|nl|> The queen of Naples. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Soft, sir! one word more. <|nl|> They are both in either's powers; but this swift business <|nl|> I must uneasy make, lest too light winning <|nl|> Make the prize light. <|nl|> One word more; I charge thee <|nl|> That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp <|nl|> The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself <|nl|> Upon this island as a spy, to win it <|nl|> From me, the lord on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> No, as I am a man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple: <|nl|> If the ill spirit have so fair a house, <|nl|> Good things will strive to dwell with't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Follow me. <|nl|> Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come; <|nl|> I'll manacle thy neck and feet together: <|nl|> Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be <|nl|> The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks <|nl|> Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> No; <|nl|> I will resist such entertainment till <|nl|> Mine enemy has more power. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> O dear father, <|nl|> Make not too rash a trial of him, for <|nl|> He's gentle and not fearful. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> What? I say, <|nl|> My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor; <|nl|> Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience <|nl|> Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward, <|nl|> For I can here disarm thee with this stick <|nl|> And make thy weapon drop. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Beseech you, father. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Hence! hang not on my garments. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Sir, have pity; <|nl|> I'll be his surety. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Silence! one word more <|nl|> Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What! <|nl|> An advocate for an imposter! hush! <|nl|> Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he, <|nl|> Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench! <|nl|> To the most of men this is a Caliban <|nl|> And they to him are angels. <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> My affections <|nl|> Are then most humble; I have no ambition <|nl|> To see a goodlier man. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Come on; obey: <|nl|> Thy nerves are in their infancy again <|nl|> And have no vigour in them. <|nl|>  <|nl|> FERDINAND: <|nl|> So they are; <|nl|> My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. <|nl|> My father's loss, the weakness which I feel, <|nl|> The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats, <|nl|> To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, <|nl|> Might I but through my prison once a day <|nl|> Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth <|nl|> Let liberty make use of; space enough <|nl|> Have I in such a prison. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|>  <|nl|> MIRANDA: <|nl|> Be of comfort; <|nl|> My father's of a better nature, sir, <|nl|> Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted <|nl|> Which now came from him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Thou shalt be free <|nl|> As mountain winds: but then exactly do <|nl|> All points of my command. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ARIEL: <|nl|> To the syllable. <|nl|>  <|nl|> PROSPERO: <|nl|> Come, follow. Speak not for him. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause, <|nl|> So have we all, of joy; for our escape <|nl|> Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe <|nl|> Is common; every day some sailor's wife, <|nl|> The masters of some merchant and the merchant <|nl|> Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle, <|nl|> I mean our preservation, few in millions <|nl|> Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh <|nl|> Our sorrow with our comfort. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> Prithee, peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> He receives comfort like cold porridge. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> The visitor will not give him o'er so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Look he's winding up the watch of his wit; <|nl|> by and by it will strike. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Sir,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> One: tell. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd, <|nl|> Comes to the entertainer-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> A dollar. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Dolour comes to him, indeed: you <|nl|> have spoken truer than you purposed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Therefore, my lord,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> I prithee, spare. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Well, I have done: but yet,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> He will be talking. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Which, of he or Adrian, for a good <|nl|> wager, first begins to crow? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> The old cock. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> The cockerel. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Done. The wager? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> A laughter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> A match! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ADRIAN: <|nl|> Though this island seem to be desert,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ADRIAN: <|nl|> Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Yet,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ADRIAN: <|nl|> Yet,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> He could not miss't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ADRIAN: <|nl|> It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate <|nl|> temperance. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Temperance was a delicate wench. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ADRIAN: <|nl|> The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> As if it had lungs and rotten ones. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Here is everything advantageous to life. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> True; save means to live. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Of that there's none, or little. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> The ground indeed is tawny. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> With an eye of green in't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> He misses not much. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> No; he doth but mistake the truth totally. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost <|nl|> beyond credit,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> As many vouched rarities are. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in <|nl|> the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and <|nl|> glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with <|nl|> salt water. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not <|nl|> say he lies? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we <|nl|> put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of <|nl|> the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ADRIAN: <|nl|> Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to <|nl|> their queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Not since widow Dido's time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in? <|nl|> widow Dido! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord, <|nl|> how you take it! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ADRIAN: <|nl|> 'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that: <|nl|> she was of Carthage, not of Tunis. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> This Tunis, sir, was Carthage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ADRIAN: <|nl|> Carthage? <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> I assure you, Carthage. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath <|nl|> raised the wall and houses too. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> What impossible matter will he make easy next? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> I think he will carry this island home in his pocket <|nl|> and give it his son for an apple. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring <|nl|> forth more islands. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Ay. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Why, in good time. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now <|nl|> as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage <|nl|> of your daughter, who is now queen. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> And the rarest that e'er came there. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I <|nl|> wore it? I mean, in a sort. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> That sort was well fished for. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> When I wore it at your daughter's marriage? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> You cram these words into mine ears against <|nl|> The stomach of my sense. Would I had never <|nl|> Married my daughter there! for, coming thence, <|nl|> My son is lost and, in my rate, she too, <|nl|> Who is so far from Italy removed <|nl|> I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir <|nl|> Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish <|nl|> Hath made his meal on thee? <|nl|>  <|nl|> FRANCISCO: <|nl|> Sir, he may live: <|nl|> I saw him beat the surges under him, <|nl|> And ride upon their backs; he trod the water, <|nl|> Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted <|nl|> The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head <|nl|> 'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd <|nl|> Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke <|nl|> To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd, <|nl|> As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt <|nl|> He came alive to land. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> No, no, he's gone. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, <|nl|> That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, <|nl|> But rather lose her to an African; <|nl|> Where she at least is banish'd from your eye, <|nl|> Who hath cause to wet the grief on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> Prithee, peace. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise <|nl|> By all of us, and the fair soul herself <|nl|> Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at <|nl|> Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your <|nl|> son, <|nl|> I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have <|nl|> More widows in them of this business' making <|nl|> Than we bring men to comfort them: <|nl|> The fault's your own. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> So is the dear'st o' the loss. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> My lord Sebastian, <|nl|> The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness <|nl|> And time to speak it in: you rub the sore, <|nl|> When you should bring the plaster. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Very well. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> And most chirurgeonly. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> It is foul weather in us all, good sir, <|nl|> When you are cloudy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Foul weather? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Very foul. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> He'ld sow't with nettle-seed. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Or docks, or mallows. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> And were the king on't, what would I do? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> 'Scape being drunk for want of wine. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> I' the commonwealth I would by contraries <|nl|> Execute all things; for no kind of traffic <|nl|> Would I admit; no name of magistrate; <|nl|> Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, <|nl|> And use of service, none; contract, succession, <|nl|> Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; <|nl|> No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; <|nl|> No occupation; all men idle, all; <|nl|> And women too, but innocent and pure; <|nl|> No sovereignty;-- <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Yet he would be king on't. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the <|nl|> beginning. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> All things in common nature should produce <|nl|> Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony, <|nl|> Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, <|nl|> Would I not have; but nature should bring forth, <|nl|> Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance, <|nl|> To feed my innocent people. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> No marrying 'mong his subjects? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> None, man; all idle: whores and knaves. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> I would with such perfection govern, sir, <|nl|> To excel the golden age. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> God save his majesty! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Long live Gonzalo! <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> And,--do you mark me, sir? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> I do well believe your highness; and <|nl|> did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, <|nl|> who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that <|nl|> they always use to laugh at nothing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> 'Twas you we laughed at. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing <|nl|> to you: so you may continue and laugh at <|nl|> nothing still. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> What a blow was there given! <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> An it had not fallen flat-long. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift <|nl|> the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue <|nl|> in it five weeks without changing. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> We would so, and then go a bat-fowling. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Nay, good my lord, be not angry. <|nl|>  <|nl|> GONZALO: <|nl|> No, I warrant you; I will not adventure <|nl|> my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh <|nl|> me asleep, for I am very heavy? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Go sleep, and hear us. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes <|nl|> Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find <|nl|> They are inclined to do so. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Please you, sir, <|nl|> Do not omit the heavy offer of it: <|nl|> It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, <|nl|> It is a comforter. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> We two, my lord, <|nl|> Will guard your person while you take your rest, <|nl|> And watch your safety. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ALONSO: <|nl|> Thank you. Wondrous heavy. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> What a strange drowsiness possesses them! <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> It is the quality o' the climate. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> Why <|nl|> Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not <|nl|> Myself disposed to sleep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Nor I; my spirits are nimble. <|nl|> They fell together all, as by consent; <|nl|> They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might, <|nl|> Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:-- <|nl|> And yet me thinks I see it in thy face, <|nl|> What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and <|nl|> My strong imagination sees a crown <|nl|> Dropping upon thy head. <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> What, art thou waking? <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Do you not hear me speak? <|nl|>  <|nl|> SEBASTIAN: <|nl|> I do; and surely <|nl|> It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st <|nl|> Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? <|nl|> This is a strange repose, to be asleep <|nl|> With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, <|nl|> And yet so fast asleep. <|nl|>  <|nl|> ANTONIO: <|nl|> Noble Sebastian, <|nl|> Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st <|nl|> Whiles thou art waking. <|nl|>
